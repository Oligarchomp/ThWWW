diag_s1_r1 = The air sure is fresh and moist.
diag_s1_r2 = I just wish that massive hole in the Great Barrier wasn't there.
diag_s1_r3 = I'd love to say something like "I'm not paid enough for solving incidents," but I'm literally not paid at all!
diag_s1_r4 = Hello there, Hakurei shrine maiden!
diag_s1_r5 = Do you want to give one of these little ones a try?
diag_s1_r6 = An apple? No thanks, I've been on a diet since recently.
diag_s1_r7 = Huh? No! You HAVE to eat one or else I won't let you through!
diag_s1_r8 = Why are you even asking, then? And what would you gain from getting in my way?
diag_s1_r9 = All of Gensokyo needs to know the fruits of my hard work! The Hakurei shrine maiden is no exception!
diag_s1_r10 = Great for you. Not going to eat one.
diag_s1_r11 = Maybe you'd be more cooperative if they were directly in your face?
diag_s1_r12 = Take your apples and go make yourself some apple humble pie or something.
diag_s1_m1 = The sky being gone is kinda funny, not gonna lie.
diag_s1_m2 = Hey, you! That black-white over there!
diag_s1_m3 = How about a nice, fresh-picked apple?
diag_s1_m4 = Isn't it the witch's role to offer poisoned apples to people?
diag_s1_m5 = It would be. If it were actually poisoned, that is.
diag_s1_m6 = Is it poisoned?
diag_s1_m7 = No.
diag_s1_m8 = Dang, I wish it was.
diag_s1_m9 = Are you going to eat it or not?
diag_s1_m10 = You seem really insistent on me eating one. Pretty suspicious if you ask me.
diag_s1_m11 = You thinking I could possibly try to poison someone is truly an insult! You leave me no choice but to...
diag_s1_m12 = Throw apples at me?
diag_s1_m13 = Saying it like that DOES make it sound stupid, but that's precisely what I intend to do!
diag_s1_m14 = *crunch* Puh, awful and clearly not poisoned. What a shame.
diag_s1_s1 = "Hey Sanae, the sky is broken. Now go and do something about that. And be back for dinner."
diag_s1_s2 = God, why are gods always so indolent?
diag_s1_s3 = Hello, young lady.
diag_s1_s4 = Want to take a bite out of one of these?
diag_s1_s5 = Huh? Sure. I didn't eat anything this morning.
diag_s1_s6 = *crunch* *crunch* *crunch*
diag_s1_s7 = So how does it taste? Pretty good, eh?
diag_s1_s8 = OH MY GOD! IT'S SO AWFUL!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TRYING TO KILL ME!?
diag_s1_s9 = What?? No way!!
diag_s1_s10 = YES WAY! PREPARE TO DIE!!
diag_s1_s11 = *crunch* *crunch* *crunch*
diag_s1_s12 = These are really awful. *crunch* 
diag_s2_r1 = So there are crabs around here? Never knew that.
diag_s2_r2 = I hope they aren't some sort of invasive species...
diag_s2_r3 = How dare you!
diag_s2_r4 = Crabs are way too nice and polite to be invasive! I mean, look at them! Aren't they cute?
diag_s2_r5 = I guess? Hey, do you mind if I were to take one or two with me?
diag_s2_r6 = Why? To make pets out of them?
diag_s2_r7 = I'm not THAT weird! I just want to make some crab tempura, now that I know I can easily fetch them here.
diag_s2_r8 = You want to EAT them??
diag_s2_r9 = Uh, yeah? Is something wrong?
diag_s2_r10 = Of course! You can't just EAT them! Crabs have feelings and families! Look at me, do I go around eating humans?
diag_s2_r11 = Don't you? Isn't that a youkai thing?
diag_s2_r12 = What? That's news to me???
diag_s2_r13 = Anyway. Perish.
diag_s2_r14 = Alright, fresh seafood, here I come!
diag_s2_r15 = ...Wait, where did they all go?
diag_s2_r16 = *Sigh* So much for a free meal...
diag_s2_m1 = Lotsa crabs, huh?
diag_s2_m2 = Makes me hungry for some shabu-shabu. Shame it's summer right now...
diag_s2_m5 = My god, I can't believe it!
diag_s2_m6 = You! Your hair! It looks so dry! Do you even TRY to take care of it?
diag_s2_m7 = Hey, at least I successfully managed to not make it look like a pineapple!
diag_s2_m8 = You should wash it more often! Seeing people mistreat their hair like this makes me so mad!
diag_s2_m9 = What do you mean? Every day I empty a whole basin of water on myself and then dry off using my mini-hakkero.
diag_s2_m10 = Takes two minutes and you're good for the day! A human's life is too short for showers, lemme tell ya.
diag_s2_m11 = This is too much! I'll make you take care of yourself whether you like it or not!
diag_s2_m12 = For starters, I'll be giving you a nice cold bath in the lake!
diag_s2_m13 = Please, don't assault hungry people with crabs. That's not very nice.
diag_s2_s1 = Since when were there crabs in this lake?
diag_s2_s2 = What, has the Outside World forgotten about crabs too? That's so sad!
diag_s2_s3 = Hey, the lady with green hair!
diag_s2_s4 = Sorry, I was passing by and I couldn't fail to notice about your hair dye.
diag_s2_s5 = My hair dye? It's my natural color!
diag_s2_s6 = What? B-but aren't you human?
diag_s2_s7 = It comes with the living god starter pack, you can choose a new hair color! 
diag_s2_s8 = It used to be brown, but Lady Kanako told me that you had better stand out in Gensokyo.
diag_s2_s9 = Hair with godly power?
diag_s2_s10 = Now THAT'S a challenge for me! Come here, I'll give you a sweet new haircut!
diag_s2_s11 = No way, back off!
diag_s2_s12 = The enemy youkai: Exterminated!$My hair's condition: Intact!$Clear Bonus: All mine!
diag_s3_r1 = It's pretty chilly up here. Shrine maiden clothes really aren't the best in those situations.
diag_s3_r2 = Did they not take into account the fact that we fly to Heaven to solve incidents?
diag_s3_r3 = I've found a shrine maiden!
diag_s3_r4 = But it's not Miss Sanae. How sad!
diag_s3_r5 = Yeah, it's easy to tell us apart because the Moriya have faith and food while I don't.
diag_s3_r6 = So, where are you heading to, not-Moriya shrine maiden?
diag_s3_r7 = Why do you want to know? To try and stop me if you don't like where I'm going?
diag_s3_r8 = What? No, I'm just curious! ^^
diag_s3_r9 = I'm doing my duty as the guardian of the Hakurei Barrier. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll...
diag_s3_r10 = Hakurei?
diag_s3_r11 = Could it be... that you're the Hakurei shrine maiden? :?
diag_s3_r12 = Uh... Usually when youkai think of shrine maidens, they think of me before Sanae.
diag_s3_r13 = That won't do! The Hakurei are the natural enemy of the Moriya!! Everyone knows that!! 
diag_s3_r14 = What year do you think you're living in? 2007?
diag_s3_r15 = Silence, Hakurei! I'll take you down, right here and right now!! >:(
diag_s3_r16 = Whooow... My head's spinning!!
diag_s3_r17 = Wait, it's already over? I didn't even finish you off. You blew yourself up on that last one.
diag_s3_r18 = I can't take it anymore! I'm waaay too tired! 
diag_s3_r19 = Plus, it's starting to rain and I don't want to short circuit. :(
diag_s3_r20 = Huh? Oh, she's right, it IS raining.
diag_s3_m1 = For once, getting through Youkai Mountain went pretty smoothly.
diag_s3_m2 = Guess they finally understood who's the boss around here!
diag_s3_m3 = Huh? Boss?
diag_s3_m4 = Are you talking about me?
diag_s3_m5 = No, I'm not. And you are?
diag_s3_m6 = I'm a fan, obviously! :)
diag_s3_m7 = Yeah, sorry, I don't do autographs. 
diag_s3_m8 = Aren't you a fan fan?
diag_s3_m9 = If you're looking for fans, I know Yuyuko has a really big one.
diag_s3_m10 = So you're a fan fan fan then?
diag_s3_m11 = I'm not a fan.
diag_s3_m12 = I can tell that much. :/
diag_s3_m13 = The more it goes, the less "fan" feels like an actual word.
diag_s3_m14 = But if you are not a fan, a fan fan, a fan fan fan or any type of fan^x then we have a problem.
diag_s3_m15 = Could you please shut up?
diag_s3_m16 = As the main representative of fans, I shall defeat the non-fan that you are!
diag_s3_m17 = I can tell you I'm not a fan of the idea.
diag_s3_m18 = Wow wow wow! Why is everything spinning?
diag_s3_m19 = Hey, that's not fair! You're not supposed to just, y'know, give up like that!
diag_s3_m20 = I didn't give up! I just decided I'd lost on my own since I'm all worn out!
diag_s3_m21 = Yeah, that's giving up.
diag_s3_m22 = Uh-oh, it's starting to pour. I'd better go find some shelter!
diag_s3_m23 = Mmmhh... Looks like I'm going to take that shower after all...
diag_s3_s1 = I can't really see anything, but Bhavaagra should be a little higher up from here.
diag_s3_s2 = Maybe I should have gone straight up instead of going down the mountain to try to find Reimu...
diag_s3_s3 = What a pleasant surprise!
diag_s3_s4 = Hello, Miss Sanae! It's been a long time, hasn't it? :)
diag_s3_s5 = Do I... know you?
diag_s3_s6 = W-what? You don't remember me?? O_o 
diag_s3_s7 = I usually remember people with freaky clothing styles pretty well...
diag_s3_s8 = But hold on... That fan over there...
diag_s3_s9 = Me?
diag_s3_s10 = Not you, the fan... Is that... the one we had way back then? When we first came to Gensokyo?
diag_s3_s11 = So does that mean...
diag_s3_s12 = :)
diag_s3_s13 = That you STOLE it??
diag_s3_s14 = What!? Nooooooooooo!! :(
diag_s3_s15 = Miss Sanae, please, let me explain! T-T
diag_s3_s16 = I don't negotiate with criminals! Give it back! 
diag_s3_s17 = If you don't want to listen to me, I guess I'll need to calm you down first! >:(
diag_s3_s18 = Had enough? You choose to surrender?
diag_s3_s19 = Miss Sanae, I have a lot of things to explain to you! Please listen to me!
diag_s3_s20 = You lost, why would I?
diag_s3_s21 = Well you see, I... There was... I mean, I was... Where do I even start?? 
diag_s3_s22 = Is that rain? Oh man, I can't stay here! Miss Sanae! I'll catch you up later!
diag_s3_s23 = Rain? It didn't seem like it was going to rain when I was down there...
diag_s4_r1 = Miss Hakurei!
diag_s4_r2 = I'm sensing something abnormal about the current weather and I require your assistance.
diag_s4_r3 = Yeah, thanks Sherlock! But I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. You know, the sky and all.
diag_s4_r4 = We do not have time to bargain. Please, rethink your priorities!
diag_s4_r5 = Huh? I'm having a strange feeling of déjà vu...
diag_s4_r6 = Also, what the heck? How is it raining in Heaven? Aren't we above the clouds?
diag_s4_r7 = Uh... Hello, could you help me?
diag_s4_r8 = I'm looking for a celestial with blue... Wait, are you Reimu?
diag_s4_r9 = No, I'm the Pope. Of course I'm Reimu! Two people in a row who don't know me? THAT'S the biggest incident of all!
diag_s4_r10 = But nevermind that, who are YOU? You're human, aren't you? What are you doing in Heaven?
diag_s4_r11 = Well, uh... My name is Yuuto Ichika, and if I'm here, it's kinda because of you?
diag_s4_r12 = ...Oh! I remember now! You were there during those fights in the aether world, weren't you?
diag_s4_r13 = Yeah... and you kind of, uh... sealed off all the abyss portals? ...with me still on this side?
diag_s4_r14 = Okay, but in my defense, you really look like you'd be native to Gensokyo, with the mobcap and all.
diag_s4_r15 = I was hoping to find you... to ask you to re-open a portal... for me to go back... so...... could you... do that?
diag_s4_r16 = You don't seriously mean that, right? Do you know how much of an hassle it was to chase every intruder back there?
diag_s4_r17 = B-but... Pretty please?
diag_s4_r18 = Let me think really hard about it. Mmmmmmmmhhhhhhhh... Still no.
diag_s4_r19 = D-don't force me to resort to violence! 'Cause you'll d-definitively regret it!
diag_s4_r20 = You look like you can barely fly on your own and you want to pick a fight with me?
diag_s4_r21 = Let me show you a spell or two I've learned during my adventures! H-here I come!
diag_s4_r22 = Nice spell! I wonder where THAT one comes from!
diag_s4_r23 = Mmggg... This isn't fair... I just want to go home...
diag_s4_r24 = Usually, it wouldn't be an issue for me, but Gensokyo's barrier is just too strong for my spells!
diag_s4_r25 = What do you mean? If there's any time to bypass the barrier, it's right now thanks to that giant hole.
diag_s4_r26 = Oh. Yeah. I... kinda forgot about that...
diag_s4_r27 = Seriously? Talk about wasting my time...
diag_s4_r28 = W-well, a lot of things were going on in Heaven! There was that giant boat falling from the sky, then the rain and...
diag_s4_r29 = I beg your pardon? A giant boat? What?
diag_s4_r30 = Y-yeah? It's so big it's still somewhat visible through the rain. It's right over there...
diag_s4_r31 = That's a boat? I thought it was a part of the landscape! My shrine maiden senses are tingling...
diag_s4_m1 = Miss Kirisame!
diag_s4_m2 = I can sense that this rain is no natural phenomenon. I would like you to act...
diag_s4_m3 = After you try to shoot me down?
diag_s4_m4 = This is ridiculous but you leave me no choice.
diag_s4_m5 = The weather's messed up every time I come to Heaven. That's kinda funny.
diag_s4_m6 = Seeing Iku reminded me I wanted to stea... inspire myself from her laser-star spell. Can't forget about that!
diag_s4_m7 = Uh...? Is that... Marisa?
diag_s4_m8 = It's really her. H-hey Marisa!
diag_s4_m9 = Oh! Hey there, Patchouli!
diag_s4_m10 = S-stop that, I'm not Patchouli...
diag_s4_m11 = ...No way, it's Bluechouli! What's up since last time?
diag_s4_m12 = My name isn't B-Bluechouli either. It's Yuuto Ichika! Yuu-To-I-Chi-Ka!
diag_s4_m13 = Yeah, yeah, but you're basically just Patchouli but blue so I'm still gonna call you that.
diag_s4_m14 = P-please don't? Would you like if I were to call you, uh... "Stupid... lame... magician that... stinks"... Or something?
diag_s4_m15 = Sure, go ahead.
diag_s4_m16 = I won't stand for this! I-I won't let anyone treat me like a bootleg anymore!
diag_s4_m17 = What are you gonna do? Fight me? With that "how to beat the black-white in front of me?" book of yours? 
diag_s4_m18 = I-I've already defeated you once! I can do it again!
diag_s4_m19 = Yeah, it was just like that one fight I had against Cirno. I went easy on you back then, y'know?
diag_s4_m20 = Y-you're bluffing! A-anyway, I've learned a ton of new spells since last time! I can definitely do it! I think?
diag_s4_m21 = Hey Bluechouli, I'll let you know that stealing people's spells is MY thing.
diag_s4_m22 = Aaawwww... I'm so weak... Losing against you means I'm not the strongest magician yet...
diag_s4_m23 = BUT, but... I WILL get stronger! I HAVE to be! For me... and for her! 
diag_s4_m24 = Dang, you're gonna make me cry.
diag_s4_m25 = I-I'll train really hard, and one day you'll even call me by my actual name!
diag_s4_m26 = Sure thing, Cirno.
diag_s4_m27 = My telekinesis powers will get so strong, I'll be able to lift things as heavy as that giant boat that came from the sky!
diag_s4_m28 = Ah, yeah. Why don't you tell me where that boat is? I'm asking for a boat enthusiast friend of mine.
diag_s4_s1 = Miss Kochiya!
diag_s4_s2 = The rain! Something is wrong! As an incident resolver, please do something about it!
diag_s4_s3 = Uh... And why are you telling me this? Don't you see I'm already in a hurry?
diag_s4_s4 = I'm trying to be of help, but if you won't cooperate, I'll force you to.
diag_s4_s5 = All this rain... No, no, keep your cool, Sanae... 
diag_s4_s6 = You're stronger than your frog DNA! Stay focused! Rain does NOT make you want to sing and dance!
diag_s4_s7 = Excuse me, uh... The lady over there...
diag_s4_s8 = ...Are you alright? W-why are you shaking like that?
diag_s4_s9 = Shaking? I'm not shaking! *shakes*
diag_s4_s10 = Oh... okay, cool. 
diag_s4_s11 = Uh... anyway, I'm looking for a celestial with blue hair. We kind of lost each other in that rain. Did you see her?
diag_s4_s12 = (Abnormal rain -> Weather incident -> She's looking for this incident's culprit -> Which means...)
diag_s4_s13 = The rain is because of YOU! AH! Too easy!
diag_s4_s14 = W-w-what?? Uh... no??? 
diag_s4_s15 = You think you can fool me with just an "it's not me!"?
diag_s4_s16 = Uh... yes? I mean... no? But it's not me! The rain started when that...
diag_s4_s17 = I've had more than enough of people trying to bargain with me! Just accept your extermination already!
diag_s4_s18 = E-extermination?? Y-you wouldn't...
diag_s4_s19 = Wait a second, you're human! I can't possibly exterminate you! My bad!
diag_s4_s20 = Phew, glad to hear!
diag_s4_s21 = I'll just be content with beating you to a pulp!
diag_s4_s22 = Y-you're really scaring me, but if you think I won't stand and fight, then you're sorely mistaken!
diag_s4_s23 = Stealing one's spell truly is the epitome of a lack of common sense! I should definitely learn from your example!
diag_s4_s24 = I'll forgive you for causing the rain, for you taught me a very important lesson.
diag_s4_s25 = I-I'm not the one responsible for the rain, y-you know? 
diag_s4_s26 = I was about to tell you it started when that giant boat fell from the sky, over there...
diag_s4_s27 = A boat? Just like the first incident I solved! That really takes me back...
diag_s4_s28 = And just like back then, I have to go get a closer look!
diag_s4_y = Y-you think you got me, but I have you all figured out! H-how do you like THIS one?
diag_s5_r1 = This boat is huge! And it's almost as empty as my donation box!
diag_s5_r2 = Huh? Did I hear something just now? It sounded somewhat animal-like...
diag_s5_r3 = I'm just done with the repairs and NOW an intruder shows up?
diag_s5_r4 = Hello, hello. Hey, I know we just met and all, but could you do me a favor? 
diag_s5_r5 = Could you, like, go away? And not come back? Thanks in advance!
diag_s5_r6 = How about I go straight ahead and put a stop to whatever is the latest incident in town?
diag_s5_r7 = Oh! You're here because of the rain? Ugh, I KNEW it, what a pain! 
diag_s5_r8 = Are you sure you don't just have a spontaneous urge to just leave? 
diag_s5_r9 = Alright, starting extermination in 5... 4... 3...
diag_s5_r10 = Wait, listen! We're only trying to leave this place, so if you just let the flood happen, we'll be gone in no time! 
diag_s5_r11 = Strangely, I don't feel drawn to the idea of you destroying the place I live in...
diag_s5_r12 = Only one world disappearing? Big deal. Come on, nobody will ever miss you.
diag_s5_r13 = That's kind of the point of Gensokyo -- to not be missed. But whatever, stay in your little bubble.
diag_s5_r14 = Uh... no? That's exactly what we're trying NOT to do. I've already told you, we're trying to leave your fake world. 
diag_s5_r15 = Fake?
diag_s5_r16 = Yeah? You know, like, you can literally pierce through it? Not the strongest thing ever, your barrier.
diag_s5_r17 = So you're ALSO responsible for the hole in the sky? Is it Christmas already? I get to solve two incidents at once!
diag_s5_r18 = Come again? I cannot allow you to go further, you know? We can't stay here, and the sooner we leave, the better. 
diag_s5_r19 = 2... 1... 0. Extermination time.
diag_s5_r20 = Serves you right! I hope you liked that demonstration of what a Shinto shrine maiden can do!
diag_s5_r21 = Why are you telling me this like I'm part of some religious movement? 'Cause we aren't.
diag_s5_r22 = Oh? I thought... Nevermind. I won, you lost. Bring in the real deal!
diag_s5_r23 = Dang it! I need to go report on the situation now.
diag_s5_r24 = I'm leaving now, but don't follow me. I'm not going to see the one causing the rain or anything. See you later... NOT!
diag_s5_r25 = Hey! You think you can just leave like that? Come back here!
diag_s5_m1 = Why do incidents always make me go through giant, empty hallways that seem to never end?
diag_s5_m2 = What's up, can't anyone afford a good architect? 
diag_s5_m3 = Yeah, this place is kinda big.
diag_s5_m4 = Even I can get lost sometimes. But at least, there is a lot of space for us animals! 
diag_s5_m5 = Sadly, there is no more room for you! So I'll ask you to leave at once!
diag_s5_m6 = Sure, I'll leave by going straight ahead and seeing who your boss is.
diag_s5_m7 = Oh. I understand why you're here now. But yeah, could you like, not intervene please? It's for everyone's sake.
diag_s5_m8 = With this flood, we will leave this place, and your world will be utterly destroyed. Truly a win-win situation!
diag_s5_m9 = Even the marketplace god herself wouldn't believe in a trade that fair.
diag_s5_m10 = But I'm more a "take" gal than a "trade" one, so I won't let you guys force me into a deal.
diag_s5_m11 = What a pain. A pitiful creature, living in a pitiful world...
diag_s5_m12 = The day you die, no one will care, no one will shed a single tear, and no one will remember you.
diag_s5_m13 = That's why I'm living in Gensokyo! You don't fear those kind of things here! You just gotta live!
diag_s5_m14 = You're only saying that because you don't know anything beyond your little bubble. 
diag_s5_m15 = Should it pop, the only thing you'd be left with would be your eyes so you can weep.
diag_s5_m16 = Actually, that's a euphemism. You and everything you've ever known would be gone forever.
diag_s5_m17 = Eh. We can't be more forgotten than we already are.
diag_s5_m18 = But what we REALLY care about is beating people like you that act like they're super important and all.
diag_s5_m19 = I guess fighting is unavoidable. Too bad. But don't go thinking I'm no opponent just because I'm a bird! 
diag_s5_m20 = Don't worry, the idea of gauging you hadn't even crossed my mind.
diag_s5_m21 = Pop! Y'hear that? That's the sound of a bubble popping. I've heard it inside another ship before, actually.
diag_s5_m22 = I don't have a single clue what you're talking about...
diag_s5_m23 = But this is bad! I don't want to be stuck down here! Birds need space to fly, and this place is suffocating!
diag_s5_m24 = Why does it have to be this complicated? How did it come to this?
diag_s5_m25 = 'Cause I beat you up, remember?
diag_s5_m26 = Hey, I'll be leaving, but I'm totally going in the wrong direction, so don't follow me. See you and get lost.
diag_s5_m27 = Homing pigeons always find their way back home, eh?
diag_s5_s1 = I can faintly hear the rain through the walls...
diag_s5_s2 = Ahhh... It feels good. Gotta love the sound of rain falling on wood!
diag_s5_s3 = Hey! Who the heck are you?
diag_s5_s4 = And what are you doing here? This is no place for humans! I don't want you in my way, I have stuff to do.
diag_s5_s5 = I was taking a stroll, casually listening to the rain you guys are causing outside. 
diag_s5_s6 = Oh. I see. Flooding and destroying whole worlds isn't quite an acceptable thing yet?
diag_s5_s7 = Wow, okay, that escalated quickly but I'm glad we're on the same page!
diag_s5_s8 = But don't worry, for your world is nothing but a counterfeit. So losing it isn't much of a loss in the long run.
diag_s5_s9 = Well, I'd be sad! I forfeited my past life to come here! I don't want Gensokyo to be gone just yet!
diag_s5_s10 = Humans really are materialistic, just like always. Living only for themselves, in their own little bubble. 
diag_s5_s11 = Well, sorry if I want to LIVE!
diag_s5_s12 = Live? You're just satisfied existing in ignorance, blinding yourself to what you don't understand.
diag_s5_s13 = Why are you lecturing me? I just want to beat people up and have fun! 
diag_s5_s14 = YOU'RE the one really living in a bubble right now, with all your big speeches and such!
diag_s5_s15 = Sadly, it's been a long time since my bubble was popped.
diag_s5_s16 = I wouldn't feel at home in any other, and I know she feels the same way as I do.
diag_s5_s17 = That's why we shall leave this place at once. So please, be a nice girl and don't be a pain for me!
diag_s5_s18 = Uh-uh! The rule here is simple: If you try to do bad stuff, a cute girl will show up and beat you up in a flash!
diag_s5_s19 = ...And where is she?
diag_s5_s20 = Okay, you're dead.
diag_s5_s21 = Should I put this little bird in a cage? Maybe I can make her sing for me?
diag_s5_s22 = I am NOT singing for you, nor for anyone else for that matter!
diag_s5_s23 = Why can't things be simple? Why can't you just let us do our stuff? That'd make my life way easier!
diag_s5_s24 = Dang it! I'll have to make a report now. 
diag_s5_s25 = Tell your master I said "hi" and that I'm approaching at an alarming speed.
diag_s5_s26 = I won't, 'cause I'm going to do something unrelated to what I just said I'd do. Now, shoo, leave me alone!
diag_s5_s27 = Got it. I'm right behind you!
diag_s6_r1 = Don't you ever know when it's time to give up?
diag_s6_r2 = I'M the one who's supposed to say that, you know?
diag_s6_r3 = All of this rain!
diag_s6_r4 = Alright, I've had enough. Show yourself now!
diag_s6_r5 = What's that? Stowaways?
diag_s6_r6 = If you're looking for a ride out of this world, we do not take passengers. Even less so when they invite themselves in. 
diag_s6_r7 = No one will be leaving Gensokyo today, should it be me, you or anyone else trying to mess with the barrier.
diag_s6_r8 = A ship can only stay at bay for so long. And this place is not the harbor we have been looking for.
diag_s6_r9 = But allow me to introduce myself. Nua Kouzui, Captain of the Great Ark, currently looking for a new home.
diag_s6_r10 = Reimu Hakurei, shrine maiden and professional youkai-jutsu martial art amateur.
diag_s6_r11 = And I also stop incident-makers during my free time. You know, people like you.
diag_s6_r12 = What? We are merely trying to take our leave!
diag_s6_r13 = My ability to cause floods will allow our vessel to reach for the broken sky and for us to take back our freedom!
diag_s6_r14 = Yeah, but I'd prefer a method that doesn't include the destruction of Gensokyo. You know, for convenience?
diag_s6_r15 = This bubble is suffocating, you know that? It's so small, it really feels like a birdcage...
diag_s6_r16 = Did you break our sky just to tell me that this place sucks? That's some serious dedication...
diag_s6_r17 = Our docking down here wasn't planned, you see. We kind of... sank.
diag_s6_r18 = And of course, your little insignificant barrier couldn't handle the sheer weight of my proud ship!
diag_s6_r19 = You... sank? Sinking, bubbles... Is Gensokyo nothing but some sort of bathtub to you?
diag_s6_r20 = Ah, ah! You're not even that far off. Except you are not a bathtub, but only mere foam!
diag_s6_r21 = Okay, I officially give up on the idea to understand what anyone is saying on this boat...
diag_s6_r22 = And when I don't understand something, I just shoot down whatever's in front of me!
diag_s6_r23 = As expected, humans just can't get the bigger picture. What frivolous creatures.
diag_s6_r24 = Nua: I will not miss this world once it's gone!$Reimu: Gensokyo loves dreaming people!
diag_s6_m1 = Can you tell me what word from "don't follow me" you didn't understand, exactly?
diag_s6_m2 = Why, "don't", obviously.
diag_s6_m3 = Now that I think about it. An incident about rain and flood...
diag_s6_m4 = I somehow get the feeling I've already seen that before?
diag_s6_m5 = What am I hearing? Stowaways?
diag_s6_m6 = Oh. Nevermind, it's just a little girl. Unfortunately for you, human passengers are forbidden.
diag_s6_m7 = There can only be passengers if this ship starts to move. You'd then need the one causing the rain to still be standing.
diag_s6_m8 = Nothing can stop the Great Ark from reaching the broken sky, but allow me to introduce myself nonetheless.
diag_s6_m9 = I'm Nua Kouzui! I've been sailing through worlds for God knows how long in hopes of finding a new home.
diag_s6_m10 = The name's Reimu Hakurei, I love starving to death and having impossible-to-capture Last Words. 
diag_s6_m11 = Tell me, young Kirisame, I can see the stars you have in your eyes. That thirst for freedom... 
diag_s6_m12 = It's really beautiful out there, outside this bubble. All of those worlds in an endless scenery...
diag_s6_m13 = Beautiful, but very lonely. Luckily for me, I have all of my pets!
diag_s6_m14 = You said "tell me", but then you talked about yourself and didn't ask a single question.
diag_s6_m15 = How did I break the sky, you ask? To be frank, it was an accident. We sunk at sea. Or at bubble, I guess.
diag_s6_m16 = Because, why would anyone willingly come to this stifling world? It feels like a giant cage!
diag_s6_m17 = You should be thanking me! Thanks to my ability to cause floods, I shall free you from this prison!
diag_s6_m18 = Say, how many people did you bore to death by talking nonsense non-stop?
diag_s6_m19 = None?
diag_s6_m20 = You missed the line, but I'll say it anyway: Thirteen.
diag_s6_m21 = Communicating with humans is such a pain.
diag_s6_m22 = No wonder, you're talking to yourself.
diag_s6_m23 = Do not worry, for I am also qualified when it comes to more violent exchanges!
diag_s6_m24 = Nua: Now, drown like the rest of your counterfeit world!$Marisa: Will you just shut up, Murasa 2?
diag_s6_s1 = Leave. Me. Be. Please use your human brain to recognize this human speech pattern!
diag_s6_s2 = The mighty Space Warrior is dangerously approaching the one pulling the strings. 
diag_s6_s3 = The marvelous Sanae has reached the Evil Lord's lair...
diag_s6_s4 = In an heroic and eloquent way, she claims: "AH-HAH! Found you!"!
diag_s6_s5 = What is all this noise about? A stowaway?
diag_s6_s6 = A human no less. If it's to ask me to take you out of this world, while I understand your pain, the answer's no.
diag_s6_s7 = Tada! You thought I wouldn't come and stop you, did you? AH! Wrong, wrong and wrong! Here I am!
diag_s6_s8 = ...And who are you?
diag_s6_s9 = I am the "Miraculous and Wonderful Deified Wind Priestess of the Mountain, Loved by Gods and Children"!
diag_s6_s10 = Also known as Sanae Kochiya.
diag_s6_s11 = I see. Nua Kouzui is my name. Captain of the Great Ark and currently leaving this place.
diag_s6_s12 = Trying to flee after seeing me? I understand, I understand. Don't worry, I get it, it's okay.
diag_s6_s13 = It's this giant prison I'm trying to leave! I'm looking for a new home, but this place's way too small!
diag_s6_s14 = But thanks to my ability, our unwanted halt will finally come to an end once the water level reaches the sky!
diag_s6_s15 = Oh, oh... Is it bad guy exposition monologue time already?
diag_s6_s16 = We hit something while sailing up there and we sank, shattering your barrier in the process.
diag_s6_s17 = That thing must have been pretty massive to damage my beloved ship, but here we are.
diag_s6_s18 = My most trusted companion told me she saw a Leviathan, but honestly she just speaks nonsense.
diag_s6_s19 = The only one speaking nonsense here is you! What in the world are you talking about? I'm so confused!
diag_s6_s20 = The important part is: we leave and this dummy world ceases to exist.
diag_s6_s21 = So you understand I can't let a little girl who believes herself to be a superhero impede my plans!
diag_s6_s22 = Fear not, Gensokyo! Green Power Sanae is here to save the day! And all of the other days while she's at it!
diag_s6_s23 = I think the idea of you wanting to fight has gotten through by now. But worry not, I shall stand to your expectations!
diag_s6_s24 = Nua: All aboard! Destination -- your world's imminent doom!$Sanae: Super Sanae Mode Ultra Fight!   
diag_s7_r1 = The broken sky is so pretty, don't you think? I could watch it for hours!
diag_s7_r2 = Enjoy it while it lasts, it'll be gone very soon.
diag_s7_r3 = What? No way! I want it to stay this way forever!! >:(
diag_s7_r4 = Yukari told me that even she couldn't fix the barrier with a tear that big.
diag_s7_r5 = Yeah, right. Like I'd believe anything she says!
diag_s7_r6 = Yukari? THAT's a name I haven't heard in a LONG time!
diag_s7_r7 = Ciao Bella! I see Nua caused some trouble for your world? My apologies. She has always been a little impulsive.
diag_s7_r8 = So you're that god of bubbles or whatever, right?
diag_s7_r9 = Exactly. I am Reverence, god and creator of every world.
diag_s7_r10 = Hold on... Could you be one of the Youkai Sages? 
diag_s7_r11 = I am no youkai, nor am I a sage. That is why I have allowed myself to be down here in the first place.
diag_s7_r12 = This world is really cute! Teeny tiny little bubble. But quite fragile, as we can see.
diag_s7_r13 = That Yukari person did a good job, but artificial barriers can only do so much.
diag_s7_r14 = Yeah, and the same Yukari told me you could easily fix Gensokyo's sky.
diag_s7_r15 = That is true. It's certainly within my capabilities.
diag_s7_r16 = So do it?
diag_s7_r17 = No.
diag_s7_r18 = I figured it wouldn't be that easy...
diag_s7_r19 = Sorry Bella, but a god such as myself mustn't interfere with their creations or what's happening to them!
diag_s7_r20 = I'm not in a position to say what should or shouldn't happen. If your world is decaying, it means it has to be so.
diag_s7_r21 = Didn't you just say you weren't one of the ones who created Gensokyo?
diag_s7_r22 = That's beside the point.
diag_s7_r23 = I'm pretty sure that's exactly on it.
diag_s7_r24 = But it's too late now. You entered Gensokyo, so you have to play by its rules like everyone else.
diag_s7_r25 = Wanting to pick a fight over a world? You remind me of that Yukari lady.
diag_s7_r26 = Please, don't go insulting me like that. But yeah, that's the plan.
diag_s7_r27 = How amusing. How adorable. Understood. I will play your little child game.
diag_s7_r28 = So now, if you please, silence in the audience, and...
diag_s7_r29 = Music, Maestro!
diag_s7_r30 = Bravo! Formidable! To think a human could stand against a god!
diag_s7_r31 = You gods really like to say that sort of thing after I beat you up...
diag_s7_r32 = This place really is full of surprises! I like it! I'm sure Nua is thinking the same!
diag_s7_r33 = Could this place be the one she's been looking for all these years? 
diag_s7_r34 = I don't know and I don't care. Just fix the sky already.
diag_s7_r35 = Ah, ah! Alright! I want to see more of what this world has to offer now!
diag_s7_r36 = What color do you want your new sky to be? Green? Yellow? Octarine, maybe?
diag_s7_r37 = Just make it blue, that'll be enough!
diag_s7_m1 = Back by popular demand: Me! :D
diag_s7_m2 = Don't expect me to join your non-existent fan club.
diag_s7_m3 = I just couldn't make my fans wait for my return any longer! ^^
diag_s7_m4 = Here I am, back at the giant boat, running after some soap god...
diag_s7_m5 = I don't get how soap can fix a broken sky, but hey, I'm ready to be surprised.
diag_s7_m6 = Haha, silly Nua. She's still a real child at heart, isn't she?
diag_s7_m7 = Ciao Bella! You're the human who came here earlier to stop Nua, right? 
diag_s7_m8 = Please, forgive her for her bad manners. She doesn't get many chances to interact with other humans.
diag_s7_m9 = You know someone's a god when they have asymmetrical clothes and weird back ornaments.
diag_s7_m10 = Indeed! Reverence U'n-Llisardggy, creator of everything, except for this place!
diag_s7_m11 = Oh, I get it now! You're the god of soap because you created soap, right?
diag_s7_m12 = I am NOT a soap god! I already told you that, didn't I?
diag_s7_m13 = I don't think you did. Hey, now that we're buddy-buddies, can you fix the sky?
diag_s7_m14 = Yes, I can.
diag_s7_m15 = Will you do it?
diag_s7_m16 = No, I won't.
diag_s7_m17 = Yep, that's gods for you.
diag_s7_m18 = That's how they are. Gods will let things happen as they happen, because it is how they should be happening.
diag_s7_m19 = I guess gods in Gensokyo skipped god school, 'cause they don't care in the slightest about that rule.
diag_s7_m20 = So you'll understand I can't possibly take action and decide whether this world should exist or not.
diag_s7_m21 = Technically, by not doing anything, don't you decide that it shouldn't?
diag_s7_m22 = Inaction is no action. But it is true that forgetting a world is quite more cruel than destroying it.
diag_s7_m23 = So I'll stick around until this world is completely gone! How merciful of me!
diag_s7_m24 = If gods are like this now, I'm gonna start converting to atheism.
diag_s7_m25 = And I respect that.
diag_s7_m26 = But to reach full atheism, I must defeat every god in existence. And there just happens to be one right in front of me.
diag_s7_m27 = Your conversion went pretty fast! I'm impressed!
diag_s7_m28 = Now, the orchestra has taken its seats! The show can finally begin!
diag_s7_m29 = Here is my latest composition: "Summertime Rhapsody of a Dying World"!
diag_s7_m30 = Hallelujah! Wonderful! Very impressive for a human!
diag_s7_m31 = I give up on being an atheist. It's way too much work.
diag_s7_m32 = Knowing Nua, she'd probably find this world to be very small...
diag_s7_m33 = But if everyone is as strong as you, she'd definitely have a lot of fun down here!
diag_s7_m34 = I too had a ton of fun! I'll repair your broken sky right away to apologize for my condescending behavior.
diag_s7_m35 = Go ahead.
diag_s7_m36 = I'll be watching you. I want to know how you'll do it with only soap.
diag_s7_m37 = You don't ACTUALLY want your sky to be fixed, do you?
diag_s7_s1 = Hey Miss Sanae, it's not raining anymore! So, what I wanted to tell you was...
diag_s7_s2 = You again? I'm tired of you taunting me with my fan, just give it back already! It was my favorite!
diag_s7_s3 = Flattering me won't change a thing! This time, you ARE going to listen to what I have to say! >:(
diag_s7_s4 = I have no idea what I'm doing. Is that bubble god really around here?
diag_s7_s5 = It's not like I can go closer to the barrier, Gensokyo being non-euclidean and stuff. 
diag_s7_s6 = Gensokyo? Is that the name of this world?
diag_s7_s7 = Ciao Bella! You're the one who came earlier, right? I thank you for stopping Nua from doing stupid things.
diag_s7_s8 = Oh my god!
diag_s7_s9 = That's me.
diag_s7_s10 = Finally! After all these years! An extraterrestrial encounter! 
diag_s7_s11 = The last one I saw with red and blue wings was a fake alien, but this time it's the real deal!
diag_s7_s12 = I guess? It's more of an extra-universal encounter, wouldn't it be?
diag_s7_s13 = But more than that, I am also a god. Reverence U'n-Llisardggy, creator of many worlds and many universes!
diag_s7_s14 = Sanae, creator of anmitsu with oden.
diag_s7_s15 = It's the first time I've come down here, in this "Gensokyo". That's a cute name. A cute name for a cute dying world.
diag_s7_s16 = But you're the bubble god, aren't you? Can't you just fix the sky? I was told you could.
diag_s7_s17 = I can.
diag_s7_s18 = But I won't.

diag_s7_s22 = Nua broke your barrier by accident, it had to be so. Your world will soon perish because of it, it had to be so.
diag_s7_s23 = I see. And is it also written that I will soon start beating you up?
diag_s7_s24 = It is only the natural course of action. If you want to fight, it couldn't have happened any other way.
diag_s7_s25 = The question now is this: peace or violence?
diag_s7_s26 = Answer B: violence. I thought I was pretty clear about it. What do I win?
diag_s7_s27 = A Danse Macabre with yours truly.
diag_s7_s28 = That sounds like a lot of fun!

diag_s7_s32 = And that's another victory for Super Sanae! Peace has been restored with violence once again!
diag_s7_s33 = Is everyone in "Gensokyo" as extravagant as you are? This place looks like a ton of fun!
diag_s7_s34 = I'm sure Nua would love this place too! Where is she now?
diag_s7_s35 = She's at my shrine, drinking sake with Lady Kanako. Yes, they really don't have anything else better to do.
diag_s7_s36 = Hey, did you hear of our special deal? Anyone that manages to fix the sky gets free drinks at the shrine!
diag_s7_s37 = Ah, ah! Got it. I'd better go fix your broken barrier, then.
diag_s7_s38 = Well, in that case... Cheers!

spell_comment = Spell Comment:
com_s1_mide = Apple has a lot of different designs out there. Now there's one more.$It's more "Minoriko-like" than "literally an apple" since she isn't a "personification of an apple" but a simple apple youkai here.
com_s1_midn = Apple will sometimes make apple pie out of the apples she grows.$They're sadly just as popular as her unprepared apples, though.$Oh yeah, and the name is in German because "Apple Pie" is a really boring name for a spell.
com_s1_midh = The first two humans were banished from Heaven because they ate the forbidden fruit.$While that fruit is an apple in most people's heads, its true nature isn't really made clear and is up to interpretation.
com_s1_midl = In that case, the name of the Adam's apple can be changed to whatever fruit you want it to be.$The Adam's pear? The Adam's fig? The Adam's pitaya? You name it!
com_s1_1e = One day, while roaming around, an apple fell right on Apple's head. She realized that day how much danmaku potential apples really have.
com_s1_1n = Newton's third law is the law of Action and Reaction. It can easily be explained like so:$Action: the boss shoots danmaku.$Reaction: You try to not die (and fail).
com_s1_1h = Mt. Fuji and apples from the Fuji variety share the same name.$Honestly, anyone would immediately rejoice after hearing such a cool fact.
com_s1_1l = Apple sadly isn't a wizard from Mt. Fuji.$Also, there's no power system in this game.$Also also, Reimu doesn't mention diabetes.
com_s1_2e = Not a lot of people will eat Apple's apples, so she always ends up with baskets full of rotten ones.$At least she can still throw them in your face. 
com_s1_2n = Did you know that Apple is Eirin's arch nemesis?
com_s1_2h = Apple's not that bad, come on, the world isn't black and white! She just doesn't know how to properly interact with people.
com_s1_2l = Ever on and on, I continue circling with nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony, till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing and suddenly I see that I can't break free.
com_s2_mide = The weapons and armors of the fallen soldiers slowly sink into the bottom of the sea.$How peaceful... If it wasn't for the corpses of said soldiers.
com_s2_midn = Thanks to all this equipment, the heikegani form a proud society of samurai-crabs living undersea in the Outside World. The Genji clan has been gone for a long time now, but the heikegani will keep bearing grudges over things in order to subsist.
com_s2_midh = I wonder now... If the Heike were the ones being victorious over the Genji, would the heikegani have been named the genjigani instead?
com_s2_midl = "How come she has spells with "enmity" or "grudge" in its name while she doesn't bear any grudge herself?" I hear you say. That's because she stubbornly tries to conform to the mindset of her species.$It didn't work very well, as you can see by her presence in Gensokyo.
com_s2_1e = This spell is significantly easier than another one with the word "walk" in its title.$Also, imagine the knives in this spell as crabs.
com_s2_1n = Could you, like, stop being a nuisance and step out of the crabs' way?$What do you mean they're actively aiming for you?$You're being paranoid.
com_s2_1h = Now there are vertical lanes, too!$When the knives come from above, it forces YOU to move horizontally.$How does it feels to be a crab?
com_s2_1l = So many crabs... What a sight! Now, where are they all heading to?$I read "Migration Sign", but is Gensokyo large enough to possibly be migrating somewhere?
com_s2_2e = This game is a bullet hell shooting game which is based on Japan's history.$Being based on history, the stages of the game are also based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
com_s2_2n = For example, in Stage 2, the player will have to fight against an army of enemy fairies.$Not only that, but they will find new and interesting ways to defeat enemies or bosses.
com_s2_2h = So here's this giant enemy crab! What I'll do is use Reimu here to flip over this crab on her back.$See if she shows up... Oh, here it comes...
com_s2_2l = I'll switch over to Marisa, hop on its stomach...$And you attack its weak point... for massive damage!
com_s2_3e = The crabs are done with the monkey's mischief!$Where is the monkey, you ask?$It's you, obviously. You are the monkey.
com_s2_3n = Serene tried asking for help from a chestnut, a cow pie, a bee and an usu in order to defeat you.$But then she realized that three-quarters of those things aren't even alive.
com_s2_3h = The monkey doesn't stand a single chance in this war! Crabs are literally the pinnacle of evolution!$Why do you think species naturally tend to evolve into crabs? Because they're perfect!
com_s2_3l = If a Touhou monkey character were to actually exist, her and Serene would definitely be fierce rivals.$Huh? What do you say? Ran? Two Rans? What are you talking about?
com_s3_mide = Kaleidoscopes are very similar to danmaku: you can achieve unlimited numbers of pretty combinations with a limited number of elements.
com_s3_midn = The main difference between kaleidoscopes and danmaku is that the latter's beauty also comes from the power and danger it creates.$Kaleidoscope pattern can't make you go pichun.
com_s3_midh = Being an inanimate object for 100 years is cool and all, but it's kinda boring.$I know it's weird for an electric fan of all things to become a tsukumogami, but they were already around 100 years ago so it's not impossible. 
com_s3_midl = This spell is really just meant to scare you. Some tsukumogami are like that.$Just keep your cool and it's pretty straightforward.
com_s3_1e = Which one are you talking about, Pale?$There's something like 8 billion japanese tales and legends, so you'll need to be more precise here.
com_s3_1n = Say, did you read the omake?$There are a lot of cool backstories and interesting character descriptions, so you should definitely check it out! 
com_s3_1h = And what about all of these awesome spell comments? Are you reading them all? Or at all?$You're at LEAST reading this one so that's cool.
com_s3_unused = Hey! What do you think you are doing? You're supposed to unlock these comments by playing the game! Stop reading them in the text file! >:(
com_s3_1l = It's called "Fiction Sign" because this is a reading spell with very fast bullets.$Since nobody ever reads the dialogue, I have no choice but to make you read danmaku instead.
com_s3_2e = This spell's name sounds way less impressive when you remember how small Gensokyo truly is.$You can see everything in it in less than 80 days for sure.
com_s3_2n = Do you know about that one song?$You know, the one that goes "around the world" 144 times in a row?
com_s3_2h = Pale can be a little "fantasque" and fanciful sometimes.$But that's expected from someone living in a land of fantasy.
com_s3_2l = This spell really stands to its name! I can barely breathe when doing such precise maneuvers!$Or maybe it's because I'm lacking oxygen this high in the clouds?
com_s3_3e = Here comes the washing mach... err, I mean the actual fan spell!$I don't know if you get it by now, but Pale likes spinning.$I hope you do too.
com_s3_3n = A survival spell in the main game? How rare!$Pale can't even keep up with her own attack so she will eventually blow up by herself.
com_s3_3h = (Translator's note: Danmaku means bullet curtain.)
com_s3_3l = Trust me.$You can believe in the danmaku.$:)
com_s4_mide = You might be tempted to stop shooting for an easy timeout, but if you do you'll miss out on a Bomb Extend.$The choice is yours.
com_s4_midn = The thunder is growling stronger and stronger.$Try to shoot down the familiars when close to them to prevent them from shooting arrows.
com_s4_midh = Now the tension really starts to rise!$Can you keep up with Iku's electric dance?
com_s4_midl = This spell ends up being very different from character to character.$For Marisa, it's basically a joke.$For Sanae, it can be quite insane sometimes. 
com_s4_1e = Yuuto has the ability to fuse objects with cookies.$She uses this capacity here offensively by fusing cookies with danmaku.$I wonder how they taste...
com_s4_1n = This game uses cookies to give you a personalized and targeted experience.$Wait for Yuuto's final spell and you'll see what I mean by that.
com_s4_1h = I sometimes have trouble differentiating rocks from cookies.$I'm thinking of a certain tsukumogami from a certain book of mythology when I say this.
com_s4_1l = Name a more iconic duo than Yuuto and her rocks.$I'll wait...
com_s4_2e = This one spell is one Yuuto learned when she first came to Gensokyo.$But since she has trouble casting it with her magic alone, she invokes it through objects using her psychokinesis ability. In this case, through rocks.
com_s4_2n = If you don't have any rocks lying around, try using a chair. It works just as well.
com_s4_2h = It's Astral Azure, but upgraded now.$In the original game, it allowed what she threw to bounce multiple times but I figured it would have been A LITTLE too much.
com_s4_2l = At last! The spell is finally complete! It has reached its final form!$It's now exactly the same...$But harder!!!
com_s4_3e = This spell looks somewhat familiar, doesn't it?$At least here, you can shoot down her familiars to make your life easier.
com_s4_3n = Patchouli is actually the one who taught Yuuto how to properly use magic and danmaku.$Yuuto's still not very good at both, but she's getting there!
com_s4_3h = Yuuto learned this mess of a spell in the aether world she previously was in.$For some reason, the animals there could manipulate elemental power.$I mean, so could Yuuto, but she wanted to make one that mixed all of them at once.
com_s4_3l = She made quite a bunch of rivals back there.$She wasn't very good at fighting but at least it allowed her to be here.$By here, I mean both in Gensokyo and in this game.
com_s4_4re = If Yuuto wants people to stop calling her a bootleg one day, maybe she should try to stop mimicking other people's spells.$Here, she saw Reimu's bomb and tried to replicate it.
com_s4_4rn = Despite being a spell card made on the fly, it's still pretty accurate to the original.$It really shows Yuuto's natural plagiarism capability.
com_s4_4rh = Unlike Reimu, Yuuto isn't very good with flying around.$She uses her telekinesis ability to make herself float, but it's very tiring for her.
com_s4_4rl = Do you want to know what Yuuto's actual biggest strength is?$It's her ability to make friends wherever she goes.
com_s4_4me = Now she attempts to reproduce Marisa's bomb.$But she can't possibly maintain a Master Spark for more than 1 second so she quickly loses control of it.
com_s4_4mn = She's already seen Marisa's Master Spark in the past, so it was easier for her to recreate the spell.$Or at least tried to.
com_s4_4mh = You'll need to find an object to channel your magic power through if you ever feel like casting a Master Spark yourself at home.$Yuuto tried to use her spell book but it didn't work very well.
com_s4_4ml = Yuuto made the promise to become the strongest magician ever to one of her friends.$It's going to be rough, as she isn't the only hard working magician around here.
com_s4_4se = Hold on, this doesn't look like Sanae's bomb?$Why is she so low on the screen? Where are all the lasers?
com_s4_4sn = I got it now, it's suppose to be Sanae's final spell from Mountain of Faith. Makes sense.$No, wait it doesn't, how can Yuuto know this spell even exists?
com_s4_4sh = It's a truly a miracle she managed to stand THIS long against one of the protagonist.$Is she trying to imitate Sanae's ability now?
com_s4_4sl = Yuuto's existence is also something of a miracle.$And I love her for that.
com_s5_1e = Feza found an olive branch and is bringing it back to you.$Someone could stand to learn a thing or two about the concept of personal space.
com_s5_1n = Olive branches are a sign of peace.$Or at least until they're thrown at your face as danmaku.
com_s5_1h = Finding an olive branch means finding land.$Finding land means finding hope.$But for a world of hopes and dreams, Gensokyo sure feels like a birdcage.
com_s5_1l = Olive branches alone aren't enough anymore.$Let's just take the whole damn tree at once.
com_s5_2e = Sharp-edged leaves flying all over the screen.$It's like when cutting yourself with paper.$It seems harmless but it's actually not.
com_s5_2n = Feza being a pet, it only makes sense for her to have such a move.$She even has four spells in her boss fight.
com_s5_2h = You thought the branch she was holding was just for show? Think again!$Be careful, now. This spell has a high critical hit ratio!
com_s5_2l = STAB you say? Is Feza a Grass type? Being a dove would make her Grass/Flying, wouldn't it?
com_s5_3e = Homing pigeons are known to be able to find their way back home.$Feza wished she even had a home at all.
com_s5_3n = Thanks to her abilities, Feza is basically a living compass.$Doesn't it make the one she's wearing on her strap a little redundant?
com_s5_3h = Gensokyo, being isolated from the Outside World, has its very own magnetic field.$The Youkai Mountain serves as its north pole.
com_s5_3l = Feza, you have the whole top of the screen for yourself, please let me at least keep the bottom.
com_s5_4e = Based on this spell, we can see we're currently heading south.$This information doesn't serve any purpose.
com_s5_4n = Maybe Feza's just trying to show you the exit?$How nice.$Let's ignore her.
com_s5_4h = Danmaku is coming from all four cardinal directions.$Don't be like the forgotten puppeteer -- free yourself from the horizon.
com_s5_4l = If you were wondering what those paper scrolls in Feza's bag are all about, they're maps she's made of the place outside worlds.$They're still mostly incomplete because of the nameless place's infinite nature.
com_s6_mide = There she is again.$Stage 5 bosses really hate giving people a break, huh?
com_s6_midn = If you time this spell out during a run, it looks like Feza is flying into a wall and that's hilarious.
com_s6_midh = When it comes to flying speed, Feza really can't complain.$It still pales in comparison to a tengu's though.
com_s6_midl = Feza has visited a lot of worlds over the years.$Finding the perfect one has become an illusion by now.
com_s6_1e = All good captains need to have spells based around anchors!$This one's really big for some reason.
com_s6_1n = The ark landed between two of Bhavaagra's highest peaks.$Now it's stuck up there.$But should Nua's plan ever be a success, this will soon change.
com_s6_1h = The damage done to the ship was only superficial.$Feza was quickly able to fix the hull before you even reach her in stage 5.
com_s6_1l = The Great Ark is a special kind of boat.$It's made of gopher wood, a type of wood that doesn't exist in the universe we live in.
com_s6_2e = This is Nua's myriad of doves. She's using them as living danmaku!$Do not worry, none were injured during the battle and they all safely went back to the dovecot afterward. 
com_s6_2n = Nua used to send a lot of doves around in order to find a habitable world.$Today, Feza can pretty much handle this job by herself.
com_s6_2h = Doves aren't the only pets Nua has. She has A LOT of other ones.$The Great Ark is basically a giant zoo at this point.
com_s6_2l = The ark is so big that entire ecosystems can exist in it, giving Nua's pets a proper place to live.$You can find forests, deserts or even fully submerged areas.$Too bad you only get to see a corridor and the wheelhouse.
com_s6_3e = A spell similar to one of a certain foreign god.$Both Nua and them are related to agriculture so I found it to be fitting.
com_s6_3n = There are places in the ark allocated to grape culture and wine making.$Nua herself is a really good winemaker.
com_s6_3h = Seeing Nua not being drunk is a rather rare occurrence.$She only managed to refrain from drinking for 2 spells before starting.
com_s6_3l = Nua is literally making wine as the fight progresses.$She drank a little too much of it and now you have to deal with whatever's going on in this spell.
com_s6_4e = Nua and Feza are patriarchs. One can become a patriarch by being exposed to the nothingness of the nameless place for an extremely long period of time (more details in the omake).$These two are the only ones to ever fully reach this state.
com_s6_4n = Once you fully become a patriarch, your body will cease to change.$This means you'll stop aging and won't need to sleep or eat anymore for example.$You become a constant. An unchanging self.
com_s6_4h = Patriarchs also feel emotions on a lesser scale. As if they were constantly depressed, expect they can't even feel depression.$Nua tries to compensate this hollow feeling as much as she can with alcohol.
com_s6_4l = I should maybe talk about the spell now.$Yeah...anchors.$Don't get hit.
com_s6_5e = This is it. Nua's last resort.$Once this land will be fully submerged, the ark shall be freed at last!
com_s6_5n = Nua has decided to speed up the flooding process.$Do you think you have what it takes to save this world?
com_s6_5h = Thanks to Nua, Gensokyo now truly starts to ascend!$A little more and this land shall be cleansed for good!
com_s6_5l = Waking up means the end of dreams. The end of fantasy. The end of Gensokyo.$What will you do now?$Do you want to wake up? Do you want to keep dreaming?
com_s7_mid1 = Danmaku can be considered a form of art.$If what you are dodging isn't expressing anything, then what's the point?
com_s7_mid2 = Danmaku can be considered a pure gameplay mechanic.$As long as it's fun to dodge, beauty doesn't matter.
com_s7_mid3 = Who or what keeps spinning the world around?$Inertia.$It's inertia.
com_s7_1 = God will accept anyone in her home.$You may not believe in God in a literal sense, but you can take it as "the universe".$The universe is accepting you. Because you already exist.
com_s7_2 = What about all of those revelations? Did I steal them?$No, no, you are mistaken.$Those were given to me.
com_s7_3 = Reverence uses a metronome she found for this Spell Card, but it changes directions and speed too abruptly to be used correctly. She tries to keep up as much as she can but the tempo being too fast to think of a pattern makes her just shoot random things.
com_s7_4 = Some people stay unmoved by the Dreamland, while some other want to rule over it.$Reverence will refuse to grant wishes to anyone but everybody isn't like her.
com_s7_5 = It's called the "Flammarion Engraving" but it isn't actually Flammarion's.$Did the actual author know about worlds and Reverence, or was it just a lucky close guess?
com_s7_6 = Here's one of Reverence's compositions.$Music is a vital component when creating a world (game).$I'm warmly thanking the ones who helped me in creating this one.
com_s7_7 = All of this fighting is really tiresome, so Reverence has decided to take a short break.$She's locked herself in a bubble and is letting her familiars do the hard work.
com_s7_8 = Did you ever want to know how it feels like to be a god? Well, today's your chance! $Reverence will gladly force you into her shoes so you can have a better idea on the subject.
com_s7_9 = The universe is a pond, a frog is resting in its middle.$An epitome of a world.$First Creation, then Expansion, and finally Destruction.
com_s7_10 = God is leaving now.$The show is coming to its end.$Should we call for an encore?
