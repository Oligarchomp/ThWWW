■ 1．STORY
====================================================================

 Gensokyo.
 A land of fantasy and phantasm.
 It was a normal day.
 And a normal day for Gensokyo meant it was an incident day.
 The sky.
 It was shattered into pieces. A gaping hole, as if the sky was nothing more than a glass dome.
 Three of the land's residents decided to take action.

  Reimu Hakurei

  Species: Human
  Ability: Capable of floating in the air

  Keeper of the Great Hakurei Barrier, she is to keep order and balance in Gensokyo.

  Marisa Kirisame

  Species: Human
  Ability: Capable of using magic

  An ordinary human living in the forest, she lives a quiet but active life.

  But what kind of night sky can exist without stars?


 〇 The Wind Priestess of the Mountain
  Sanae Kochiya

  Species: Living God
  Ability: Capable of causing miracles

  Shrine maiden of the Moriya Shrine, she is still actively trying to suppress all forms of her common sense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
◇ BOSSES
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 〇 Stage 1 Boss
  The Red Delicious Youkai Girl

  Apple Girlington

  Species: Youkai (Apple)
  Ability: Capable of making apples grow


  There are a lot of different types of youkai. Flower youkai, winter youkai, gap youkai, and of course... apple youkai.

  Apple spends most of her time growing apples and trying to offer them to random people, those people being other youkai, humans or even lower gods.
  She is very insistent, and her rushed grown apple aren't the tastiest, so everyone just tries to avoid her.
  "All of Gensokyo's residents will one day know the taste of the fruits of my labor!" she proclaims.

  Maybe, one day, she will stop making apples for recognition, and instead start making them for herself.
  If that day ever comes, trust me, I will be the first one to take a bite out of one of them.



 〇 Stage 2 Boss
  The Crustacean with a Human Face

  Serene Heikegani
 
  Species: Heikegani
  Ability: Capable of cutting hair


  Back in the twelfth century, a battle between the Heike clan and the Genji clan took place in a narrow strait separating Honshū and Kyūshū.
  While the Heike had the upper hand at first, they ultimately realized their defeat was inevitable. The surviving Heike flung themselves into the sea to drown 
  rather than be captured, theirs heart full of enmity for their enemy.

  Their grudge was so powerful, that it is said that all the crabs in the area since then bear rancor for the Genji Clan, explaining why their shells
  are imprinted with the scowling faces of samurai.

  Serene is one of those crabs.
  But for unexplainable reasons, she doesn't bear any grudges toward anything or anyone.
  A grudgeless grudge youkai is basically a youkai with no reason to exist, so she had trouble finding her place in youkai society and was often left alone.

  Eventually, when no one seemed to care about her anymore, not even herself, she ended up in Gensokyo. 

  The Misty Lake was obviously the goto place for her to stay.
  In a society of heikegani, being a hairdresser is extremely common and unremarkable, but in a lake with a diverse variety of youkai, it suddenly became 
  her biggest strength. Youkai in Gensokyo care a lot about looking special and cool, so her skills were extremely appreciated.
  She became somewhat popular amongst weaker youkai.

  For the first time in her life, she felt like her existence had a purpose.



 〇 Stage 3 Boss
  The Average Fan Enjoyer

  Pale Fanhead

  Species: Tsukumogami (Electric fan)
  Ability: Capable of making objects spin


  Native to the Outside World, she came to Gensokyo alongside the Moriya when they first moved in. Of course back then, she was but a simple mindless device. 
  She was a very old model, an antique. Because of that, she was eventually sent in a storage room and then forgotten about over time.

  But one day, during a certain incident, a great amount of magical power turned her into a tsukumogami, just like many other tools all over Gensokyo.
  Feeling like she wasn't needed anymore, she left the shrine. While she respected the Moriya, she had never tried to make any contact with them.
  Since then, she mostly roams around, playing pranks on humans, while avoiding the area around Youkai Mountain.

  She's really expressive, curious, silly and protective.

  When the sky broke, she got intrigued and wanted to get a closer look. So for the second time since she gain consciousness, she went to and over the mountain. 
  It was there, high up in the sky, that she met a very impatient human girl...



 〇 Stage 4 Midboss
  The Oarfish Living in the Clouds

  Iku Nagae

  Species: Youkai (Oarfish)
  Ability: Capable of reading the atmosphere

  Messenger of the Dragon Palace, she is to watch over Gensokyo's atmosphere and weather. 

  When the rain started to fall, she immediately noticed something was off.
  She tried to warn the protagonist, but they shot her down... because what else were they going to do?

  Seeing as the person responsible for the rain and the broken sky was one in the same, her input wasn't needed anyway.



 〇 Stage 4 Boss
  The Bootleg Magician From Another World

  Yuuto Ichika

  Species: Human
  Ability: Capable of using telekinesis and magic


  No, this is not Patchouli. Her name is Yuuto Ichika, a young magician trying to overcome her statue as a bootleg. 
  She travels through worlds, looking for her missing mother, while learning new spells and making new friends along the way.
  Because of a promise she made, she also sets off to become the strongest magician ever.

  One day, in the hope of finding her mother, she wanders into a strange world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. Everybody there seemed eager to pick 
  fights with everybody else, so she joined in on the brawl.
  For some unknown reason, a lot of other worlds had collided together, bringing people of all kind, and linking different places together.
  Turns out, Gensokyo was one of them. Some of its resident were there, including Reimu. 

  Once the culprit of the aether world incident was defeated, Reimu sealed off all the portals linking the two worlds... with Yuuto still wandering about in Gensokyo.
  Luckily for her, she had made friends with a celestial in the meantime, and she invited her to stay in Heaven for a while.

  Yuuto normally doesn't have much issue going from one world to another, but for some reason Gensokyo's barrier prevented her from leaving.
  Just as she was about to descend from Heaven to look for Reimu, an earthquake struck the whole of Bhavaagra. A giant boat had fallen from the sky and had
  landed on top of the highest of Heaven's peaks, all while piercing and breaking the barrier in the process.
  Panic in Heaven ensue.
  The catastrophes didn't stop there, as torrential rains then started to pour down from the sky. As a result, Yuuto lost sight of her celestial friend.

  But while roaming outside in the rain, she stumbled across someone else...



 〇 Stage 5 Boss
  The Roving White Dove

  Feza

  Species: Patriarch (Dove)
  Ability: Capable of finding land


  She was but a simple dove, Nua's first pet.

  One day, a god reached out toward Nua, and gave her a mission along with a huge amount of power to accomplish it.
  That power "leaked" onto Feza, giving her a small fraction of that god-like power.

  Of course, she was one of the pet Nua saved during the flood the latter accidentally started.

  The nameless place is one where time and space don't makes perfect sense, and has the side effect of "equalizing" or "purify" everything in it.
  Material living beings who stay in it for an extended period of time will lose any way to live or to die, so they just... exist and stop aging.
  Beings that have reached that state are called patriarchs. It is actually Nua who invented the term, since she's the first one to ever reach this state.

  Once Feza reached that state as well, coupled with the power she once received, she gained the ability to maintain a human form.
  She is the only one of Nua's pets to be able to do so.

  Using her ability, she helps Nua to find a new home for her and all of her pets. She is in charge of keeping track of where they already went, and to find
  potential habitable worlds.
  You could call her a cartographer.

  Feza has a pretty strict temperament -- she likes when things follow a plan. It's sometimes a real chore for her to deal with Nua's personality.
  But despite that, she is and will always be her most devoted companion.

  When the Great Ark was damaged, she briefly saw the thing they collided with: a Leviathan! Or at least it looked like one.

  Once they sunk into Gensokyo, she was tasked with fixing the damage done to the ship as fast as possible.
  After the repairs, on her way back, she found a hasty human roaming about inside the ark...



 〇 Stage 6 Boss
  The World-Flooding Wanderer

  Nua Kouzui

  Species: Patriarch (Human)
  Ability: Capable of causing floods

  A long, long time ago, in a different world, existed a planet very similar, yet different to Earth.
  This planet was also populated by humans, had a similar history, had similar religions, but it wasn't the Earth as we know it. 
  And on this planet, lived a normal little human girl: Nua.

  Her life was a rather simple one. She would spend a lot of time with animals, as she felt closed to them than to other people.

  But one day, a god reached for her. 
  That god claimed to be the one who created the world and asked her to fix humanity's misdeeds, or else they will destroy everything. 
  Nua was confused. She asked: Why? Why her? How? Ignoring the questions, the god gave her the "Great Power", in her own word, and left.

  Of course, a little girl couldn't possibly make up for the whole of humanity.
  She tried, but who would believe a little girl claiming to have seen God?

  She thought that maybe, the power the god lent to her was the one of "Hope" or "Forgiveness", or something similar.
  That wasn't the case. She realized her world was doomed.
  Filled with anger and grief, she accidentally found out what the "Great Power" was really all about.

  It was the power to cleanse worlds. To flood them until nothing remains.

  Once the flood ended after forty days, the only thing left in the whole universe was Nua, some of her pets, and the raft they were on, floating over 
  trillions of liters of water.

  The god came back. The results weren't what they'd expected.
  They took Nua out of the dead world.

  Since then, she has been living in the nameless place, the dimension between worlds where the god creates them, sailing from bubble to bubble.

  With the help of the god and her pets, she looks for other habitable worlds with habitable planets. 
  Through her exploring, she has discovered many different species of animals, some with unimaginable evolutionary lineage.
  Whenever she would find an injured one or one living in a dying ecosystem, she would take them in as her pet.

  Nua herself is pretty easy-going, childish and likes to get drunk, but she knows when to get serious when the situation calls for it.
  Her in-game appearance makes it hard to tell, but she's actually become a rather mature-looking woman.

  A few minutes before the game's event, the Great Ark was venturing on Gensokyo's bubble for the first time. Nua quickly noticed they were sailing on an unusual sea. 
  Something then suddenly collided with the ship, causing damage to it. 
  There was nothing that could be done -- they were sinking into the bubble. Gensokyo's artificial barrier couldn't handle the weight of the titanic boat, so it broke 
  under its pressure.
  The ship landed on Bhavaagra, causing a massive earthquake (or would that be a skyquake?) and panic in Heaven.

  Nua knew there was only one way to take the ark out of this place: flooding this world entirely, so the ark could reach the broken sky.
  She sent her pets fixing the damage, while she started the world-destroying flood.

  But what she didn't expect was for an inhabitant of this world to come and try to stop her...



 〇 Extra Stage Boss
  The Being Called By Many Names

  Reverence U'n-Llisardggy

  Species: Kotoamatsukami
  Ability: Capable of creating worlds


  In the beginning, around 13.8 billion years ago, a god created the known universe we live in.
  This god was a very special one, a kotoamatsukami, one of the first to ever exist.

  Throughout History, different religions gave a lot of different names to the concept of creation.
  But her one and only name is Reverence U'n-Llisardggy.

  Humans like to think everything was created for them, or that it was at least actively made by this greater force.
  It is not so.
  Reverence creates universes inside bubbles, floating in a nameless, infinite, non-Euclidean space.
  But her involvement stops there -- she doesn't know what's inside the bubble she blows unless she goes inside. Everything happening in them is just a
  consequence of whatever laws of physics the places inside follow.
  Bubbles will sometimes regroup together into clusters, linking those worlds directly. For example, the Outside World, the Dream World and Gensokyo are all located in separate 
  bubbles, but since they are part of the same cluster, one can "easily" go from one to another.


  A few hundred years ago, someone managed to leave the bubble they were living in on their own.
  This someone was a human-looking lady with creepy eyes. 
  The lady came to ask Reverence to create a world just for her. She obviously refused, but said she won't stop her from trying herself.
  That is how Reverence has always been -- she never gets involved in anything. She is merely a spectator of her own creations.

  The lady came and went, and tried to create a world of her own multiple times.
  One day, she succeeded, much to Reverence's surprise.


  A long, long time before those events, she would spend a lot of time visiting the worlds she created.
  During that time, she went through billions of different places and saw billions of different forms of life.

  But one day, she stumbled upon a little rock. It was floating in the middle of space, covered with water and life.
  It was Earth... but not really.
  It was extremely similar to our planet: it had humans, societies and religions, but it was not the planet Earth we know.
  On it, she discovered things she had never seen before. Hatred, wars, violence. An unimaginable amount of pain emanated from this single rock.

  She couldn't accept this.
  She couldn't accept that she had created, even indirectly, such imperfect creatures.

  So, for the first time, she decided to interfere with one of her creations.
  She reached toward a random human, a young girl, and asked her to solve all of humanity's misdeeds, for she would destroy everything if she were to fail.
  Well aware that this human couldn't just "do it", she gifted to her the power to do so.

  The next time the two of them met, the young girl and her pets were alone on a raft, floating over the girl's submerged universe.

  Animals, plants, rocks, suns, stray molecules floating in space. To Reverence, they're all the same: life. She can feel and hear the feelings of every atom.
  She considers everything that exists to deserve that existence, and holds affection for every single piece of matter that is.
  But she couldn't hear anything.
  This whole world, the entirety of the inside of the bubble, was dead. For the god, it was like losing trillions upon trillions of children.

  And it was all because of Reverence's god complex.

  Ashamed of her actions, she took the human girl with her, popped the lifeless bubble, and promised that she would never go inside another one of her
  creations ever again.

  Considering Nua as her "mistake", she tries to make up by helping her find a new home.


  Sometimes, she stares at the infinite nothingness of the nameless place, and wonders if all of this is somehow contained in another, bigger bubble...
