diag_s1_r1 = The air sure is fresh and moist.
diag_s1_r2 = I just wished there wasn't that massive hole in the Great Barrier. 
diag_s1_r3 = I'd love to say something like "I'm not paid enough for solving Incidents." but I'm literally not paid at all!
diag_s1_r4 = Hello there, Hakurei Shrine Maiden!
diag_s1_r5 = Do you want to give a try to one of those childs?
diag_s1_r6 = An apple? No thanks, I've started a diet recently.
diag_s1_r7 = Uh? No! You HAVE to eat one or else I won't let you through!
diag_s1_r8 = Why are you even asking then? And what do you gain from impeding me?
diag_s1_r9 = All of Gensokyo need to know the virtue of my hard work! The Hakurei Shrine Maiden makes no exception!
diag_s1_r10 = Great for you. Not going to eat it.
diag_s1_r11 = Maybe will you be more cooperative if you were to have them directly in your face?
diag_s1_r12 = Take your apples and go make yourself an apple humble pie or something.

diag_s1_m1 = The sky being gone is kinda funny, not gonna lie.
diag_s1_m2 = Hey, the black and white one over there!
diag_s1_m3 = What about a nice apple, freshly picked?
diag_s1_m4 = Isn't it the witch's role to offer poisoned apple to people?
diag_s1_m5 = It would be so. If it was actually poisoned that is.
diag_s1_m6 = Is it poisoned?
diag_s1_m7 = No.
diag_s1_m8 = Dang, I wish it was.
diag_s1_m9 = Are you going to eat it or not?
diag_s1_m10 = You seem very insistent on me eating it. Pretty suspisious if you ask me.
diag_s1_m11 = You thinking I can possibly try to poison someone is truly an insult! You leave me no choice but to...
diag_s1_m12 = Throw apples at me?
diag_s1_m13 = Saying it like that does sound stupid, but that's what I intend to do!
diag_s1_m14 = *Crunch* Peuh, awful and clearly not poisoned. What a shame.

diag_s1_s1 = "Hey Sanae, the sky is broken. Now go and do something about that. And be back for dinner."
diag_s1_s2 = God, Why are Gods always so indolent?
diag_s1_s3 = Hello, young lady.

diag_s1_s5 = Uh? Sure. I didn't eat anything this morning.
diag_s1_s6 = *Crunch* *Crunch* *Crunch*
diag_s1_s7 = So how does it taste? Pretty good, eh?
diag_s1_s8 = OH MY GOD! IT'S SO AWFUL!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TRYING TO KILL ME?!
diag_s1_s9 = What?? No way!!
diag_s1_s10 = YES WAY! PREPARE TO DIE!!
diag_s1_s11 = *Crunch* *Crunch* *Crunch*
diag_s1_s12 = They are really awful. *Crunch* 


diag_s2_r1 = So there is crabs around here? Never knew.
diag_s2_r2 = I hope they aren't some sort of invasive species...
diag_s2_r3 = How dare you?
diag_s2_r4 = Crabs are way too nice and polite to be invasive! I mean look at them, aren't they cute?
diag_s2_r5 = I guess? Hey, do you mind if I were to take one or two with me?
diag_s2_r6 = Why? To make pet out of them.
diag_s2_r7 = I'm not THAT weird! I just want to make some crab tempura, now that I know I can easily fetch them here.
diag_s2_r8 = You want to EAT them??
diag_s2_r9 = Uh, yeah? Something's wrong?
diag_s2_r10 = Of course! You can't just EAT them! Crabs have feelings and families! Look at me, do I go and eat humans?
diag_s2_r11 = Don't you? Isn't it a Youkai thing?
diag_s2_r12 = What? That's news to me???
diag_s2_r13 = Anyway. Perish.
diag_s2_r14 = Alright, fresh sea food, here I come!
diag_s2_r15 = ...Wait, where did they all went?
diag_s2_r16 = *Sigh* So much for some free meal...

diag_s2_m1 = Lotsa crabs, uh?
diag_s2_m2 = Makes me hungry for some Shabu Shabu. Shame it's summer right now...
diag_s2_m3 = Empty
diag_s2_m4 = Empty
diag_s2_m5 = My God, I can't believe it!
diag_s2_m6 = You! Your hair! They look so dry! Do you even TRY take care of them?
diag_s2_m7 = Hey, at least I succesfully managed to not make them look like a pineapple!
diag_s2_m8 = You should wash them more often! Seeing people mistreat their hair like this makes me so mad!
diag_s2_m9 = What do you mean? Every day I empty a whole water basin on myself and then dry using my mini-hakkero.
diag_s2_m10 = Takes 2 minutes and you good for the day! Human's life are too short for shower, I'll tell you that.
diag_s2_m11 = This is too much, I will make you take care of yourself, whether you like it or not!
diag_s2_m12 = For starters, I'll be giving you a nice cold bath in the lake!
diag_s2_m13 = Please, don't assault hungry people with crabs. That's not very nice.

diag_s2_s1 = Since when is there crabs in that lake?
diag_s2_s2 = What, has the Outside World forgotten about crabs too? That's so sad!
diag_s2_s3 = Hey, the lady with green hair!
diag_s2_s4 = Sorry, I was passing by and I couldn't fail to notice your hair dye.
diag_s2_s5 = My hair dye? It's my natural color!
diag_s2_s6 = What? B...but aren't you human?
diag_s2_s7 = It comes with the "Living God" starter pack, you can choose a new hair color! 
diag_s2_s8 = They used to be brown, but Lady Kanako told me that you'd better stand out in Gensokyo.
diag_s2_s9 = Hair with Godly power?
diag_s2_s10 = Now, THAT'S a challenge for me! Come here, I'll give you a sweet new haircut!
diag_s2_s11 = No way, back off!
diag_s2_s12 = The enemy Youkai: Exterminated!     My hair condition: Intact!            Clear Bonus: All mine!


diag_s3_r1 = It's pretty chilly up there. Why are Shrine Maiden clothes so airy?
diag_s3_r2 = Did they not take into account the fact that they will fly to Heaven to solve Incidents?
diag_s3_r3 = I've found a Shrine Maiden!
diag_s3_r4 = But it's not Lady Kochiya. How sad!
diag_s3_r5 = Yeah, it's easy to tell us appart because the Moriyas have faith and food while I do not.
diag_s3_r6 = So, where are you heading to, Not Moriya Shrine Maiden?
diag_s3_r7 = Why do you want to know? To try stop me if you don't like where I'm going?
diag_s3_r8 = What? No I'm just curious! ^^
diag_s3_r9 = I'm doing my duty as the Guardian of The Hakurei Barrier, now if you'll excuse me, I'll...
diag_s3_r10 = Hakurei?
diag_s3_r11 = Could it be...that you are the Hakurei Shrine Maiden? :?
diag_s3_r12 = Uhh... Usually when Youkai think of Shrine Maidens, they'll think of me before Sanae.
diag_s3_r13 = That will not do! The Hakurei are the natural enemy of the Moriya!! Everyone knows that!! 
diag_s3_r14 = In what time do you think you are living in? 2007?
diag_s3_r15 = Silence Hakurei! I'll take you down, right here and right now!! >:(
diag_s3_r16 = Whooow...My head's spinning!!
diag_s3_r17 = Wait, it's already over? I didn't even finsih you off. You blow yourself up on that one.
diag_s3_r18 = I can't take it anymore! I'm waaay too tired! 
diag_s3_r19 = Plus, it's starting to rain and I don't want to short circuit. :(
diag_s3_r20 = Uh? Oh, she's right, it IS raining.

diag_s3_m1 = For once, going through Youkai Mountain went pretty smoothly.
diag_s3_m2 = Guess they finally understood who's the boss around here!
diag_s3_m3 = Uh? Boss?
diag_s3_m4 = Are you talking about me?
diag_s3_m5 = No, I'm not. And you are?
diag_s3_m6 = I'm a fan, obviously! :)
diag_s3_m7 = Yeah, sorry, I don't do autographs. 
diag_s3_m8 = Aren't you a fan fan?
diag_s3_m9 = If you are looking for fans, I know Yuyuko has a really big one.
diag_s3_m10 = So you are a fan fan fan then?
diag_s3_m11 = I'm not a fan.
diag_s3_m12 = I can tell that much. :/
diag_s3_m13 = The more it goes, the less fan feels like an actual word.
diag_s3_m14 = But if you are not a fan, a fan fan, a fan fan fan or any type of fan^x then we have a problem.
diag_s3_m15 = Could you please shut up?
diag_s3_m16 = As the main representant of fans, I shall defeat the non-fan that you are!
diag_s3_m17 = I can tell you I'm not a fan of the idea.
diag_s3_m18 = Wow wow wow! Why is everything spinning?
diag_s3_m19 = Hey, that's not fair! You're not supposed to just, give up like that!
diag_s3_m20 = I didn't gave up! I've just decided on my very own that I've lost since I'm all worn out!
diag_s3_m21 = Yeah, giving up.
diag_s3_m22 = Oh oh, rain is starting to pour down. I better go find some shelter!
diag_s3_m23 = Mmmhh...looks like I'm actually going to take a shower after all...

diag_s3_s1 = I can't really see a thing, but Bhavaagra should be a little higher.
diag_s3_s2 = Maybe I sould have went straight up instead of going down the mountain to try to reach for Reimu...
diag_s3_s3 = What a pleasant surprise!
diag_s3_s4 = Hello, lady Kochiya. It has been a long time, hasn't it? :)
diag_s3_s5 = Do I...know you?
diag_s3_s6 = W...what? You don't remember me?? O_o 
diag_s3_s7 = I usually remember pretty well people with freaky clothing style...
diag_s3_s8 = But hold on...That fan over there...
diag_s3_s9 = Me?
diag_s3_s10 = Not you, the fan...Is it...The one we had back then? When we first came to Gensokyo?
diag_s3_s11 = So does it means...
diag_s3_s12 = :)
diag_s3_s13 = That you STOLE it??
diag_s3_s14 = What!? Nooooooooooo!! :(
diag_s3_s15 = Lady Kochiya, please let me explain! T-T
diag_s3_s16 = I don't negotiate with terrorists! Give it back to me! 
diag_s3_s17 = If you don't want to listen to me, guess I'll need to calm you down first! >:(
diag_s3_s18 = Had enough? Choose to surrender?
diag_s3_s19 = Lady Kochiya, I have a lot of things to explain to you! Please listen to me!
diag_s3_s20 = You lost, why would I?
diag_s3_s21 = Well you see, I...There was...I mean, I was...Where do I start?? 
diag_s3_s22 = Is that rain? Oh man, I can't stay here! Lady Kochiya! I'll catch you up later!
diag_s3_s23 = Rain? It didn't seemed like it was going to rain when I was down there...


diag_s4_r1 = Lady Hakurei!
diag_s4_r2 = I'm sensing something abnormal about the current weather and I am requiring your assistance.
diag_s4_r3 = Yeah, Thanks Sherlock! But I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. You know, the sky and all.
diag_s4_r4 = We do not have time to bargain. Please, revisit your priorities!
diag_s4_r5 = I can't see a thing! Where do I need to go? Where is the sky? Or more the lack of it?
diag_s4_r6 = My intuition is telling me I'm on the right track, so I'll just go straight ahead until I bump into someone.
diag_s4_r7 = Uh...Hello, could you help me?
diag_s4_r8 = I'm looking for a Celestial with blue...Wait, are you Reimu?
diag_s4_r9 = No, it's the Pope. Of course I'm Reimu! Two people in a row that doesn't know me? THAT'S the biggest incident of all!
diag_s4_r10 = Nevermind that, who are YOU? You're human, aren't you? What are you doing in Heaven?
diag_s4_r11 = Well, Uh...My name is Yuuto Ichika, and If I'm here, it's kinda because of you?
diag_s4_r12 = ...Oh! I remember now! You were there, during the Animal Realm Incident, weren't you?
diag_s4_r13 = Yes, and you kind of, uh..., sealed off all the Abyss Portal?...with me still on this side?
diag_s4_r14 = Okay, but in my defense, you really look like you'd be native to Gensokyo, with the mobcap and all.
diag_s4_r15 = I was hoping to find you... To ask you to re-open a Portal...For me to go back...So......Could you...Do that?
diag_s4_r16 = What? You don't seriously mean it? Do you know how much of an hassle it was to chase every intruder back there?
diag_s4_r17 = B-but...Pretty Please?
diag_s4_r18 = Let me think really hard about it. Mmmmmmmmhhhhhhhh. Still no.
diag_s4_r19 = D-Don't force me to come to violence! Cause you'll d-definitively regret it!
diag_s4_r20 = You look like you can barely fly on your own and you want to pick a fight with me?
diag_s4_r21 = Let me show you a spell or two I have learned during my adventures! He-here I come!
diag_s4_r22 = Nice spell! I wonder where THAT one comes from!
diag_s4_r23 = Mmggg...That's not fair...I just want to go home...
diag_s4_r24 = Usually, it wouldn't be an issue for me, but Gensokyo's Barrier is just too strong for my spells!
diag_s4_r25 = What do you mean? If there is a time to bypass the Barrier, now is really the best with that giant hole.
diag_s4_r26 = Oh. Yeah. I...kinda forgot about that...
diag_s4_r27 = Really now? Talk about wasting my time...
diag_s4_r28 = W-well, a lot of things was going on in Heaven! There was that giant boat falling from the sky, then the rain and...
diag_s4_r29 = I beg your pardon? A giant boat? What?
diag_s4_r30 = Y-yeah? It's so big we can even somewhat see it over there, through the rain...
diag_s4_r31 = That's a boat? I thought it was a part of the landscape! My Shrine Maiden sense is tingling...

diag_s4_m1 = Lady Kirisame!
diag_s4_m2 = I can sense that this rain is no natural phenomena. I would like you to act...
diag_s4_m3 = After you try to shot me down?
diag_s4_m4 = This is ridiculous but you leave me no choice.
diag_s4_m5 = Every time I come to Heaven, the weather is all messed up. That's amusing.
diag_s4_m6 = Seeing Iku reminds me I wanted to stea...inspire myself from her laser-star spell. Can't forget about that!
diag_s4_m7 = Uh...? Is that...Marisa?
diag_s4_m8 = It's actually her. H-hey Marisa!
diag_s4_m9 = Oh! Hey there, Patchouli!
diag_s4_m10 = S-stop that, I'm not Patchouli...
diag_s4_m11 = ...No way, It's Bluechouli! What's up since last time?
diag_s4_m12 = My name's isn't B-Bluechouli either. It's Yuuto Ichika! Yuu-To-I-Chi-Ka!
diag_s4_m13 = Yeah, yeah, but you basically are blue Patchouli so I'm still calling you that way.
diag_s4_m14 = P-Please don't? Would you like if I were to call you, Uh..."Stupid...Lame...Magician that......stinks"...or something?
diag_s4_m15 = Sure, go ahead.
diag_s4_m16 = I won't stand for that! I-I won't let anyone treat me like a Bootleg anymore!
diag_s4_m17 = What are you gonna do? Fight me? With your little "How to beat the black and white in front of me?" Book? 
diag_s4_m18 = I-I've already defeated you once! I can do it again!
diag_s4_m19 = Yeah, It was just like that one fight I had against Cirno. I went easy on you back then, y'know?
diag_s4_m20 = Y-you're bluffing! A-anyway, I've learned a ton of new spell since last time! I can definitely do it! I think?
diag_s4_m21 = Stealing people's spell? Really? Come on, Bluechouli, I thought you were better than that...
diag_s4_m22 = Aaawwww...I'm so weak...Losing against you means I'm not the strongest magician yet...
diag_s4_m23 = BUT, but...I WILL get stronger! I HAVE to be! For me...and for her! 
diag_s4_m24 = Dang, you'll make me cry.
diag_s4_m25 = I-I will train very hard, and one day you'll call me by my actual name!
diag_s4_m26 = Sure thing, Cirno.
diag_s4_m27 = My telekinesis power will get so strong, I'd be able to lift things as heavy as that giant boat that came from the sky!
diag_s4_m28 = Ah ah, yeah. Why don't you tell me where that boat is? It's for a boat enthusiast friend of mine.

diag_s4_s1 = Lady Kochiya!
diag_s4_s2 = The rain! Something is wrong with it! Please do something!
diag_s4_s3 = Uh...And why are you telling me this? Don't you see I'm already in a hurry?
diag_s4_s4 = I'm trying to be of help, but if you won't cooperate, I'll force you to.
diag_s4_s5 = All this rain...No, no, Sanae keep it cool... 
diag_s4_s6 = You are stronger than your frog DNA, so stay focus! Rain DOES NOT makes you want to sing and dance!
diag_s4_s7 = Excuse me, uh...the lady over there...
diag_s4_s8 = ...Are you alright, w-why are you shaking like that?
diag_s4_s9 = Shaking? I'm not shaking! *shakes*
diag_s4_s10 = Oh...Ok, cool. 
diag_s4_s11 = Uh...Anyway, I'm looking for a Celestial with blue-hair. We kind of, lost each other in that rain. Did you saw her?
diag_s4_s12 = (Abnormal Rain -> Weather incident -> She looking for the culprit of that Incident -> Which means...)
diag_s4_s13 = The rain is because of you! AH! Too easy!
diag_s4_s14 = W-w-what?? Uh...no??? 
diag_s4_s15 = You think you can fool me with just a "It's not me"?
diag_s4_s16 = Uh...Yes? I mean...No? But It's not me! The rain started when that...
diag_s4_s17 = I have more than enough of people trying to bagain with me! Just accept being exterminated already!
diag_s4_s18 = E-exterminate me?? Y-you wouldn't...
diag_s4_s19 = Wait a second, you are human! I can't possibly be exterminating you, my bad!
diag_s4_s20 = Pfiuu, glad to hear!
diag_s4_s21 = I'll content myself from beating you to a pulp!
diag_s4_s22 = Y-you are really scaring me, but If you think I wouldn't stand for a fight, then you are sorely mistaken!
diag_s4_s23 = Stealing one's spell truly is a lack of common sense! I should definitely take exemple on you!
diag_s4_s24 = I will forgive you for the rain, for teaching me such an important lesson.
diag_s4_s25 = I-I am not the one responsible for the rain, y-you know? 
diag_s4_s26 = I was about to tell you it started when that giant boat fell from the sky, over there...
diag_s4_s27 = Boat in the sky? It's making me nostalgic for the first incident I solved...
diag_s4_s28 = And just like back then, I better have to get a closer look!

diag_s4_y = Y...you think you got me, but I have you all figured out! H..how do you like THAT one?


diag_s5_r1 = This boat is so huge! And it's almost as empty as my donation box!
diag_s5_r2 = Uh? Did I heard something just now? It sounded animal-like...
diag_s5_r3 = I'm just done with the reparations and there is already intruders?
diag_s5_r4 = Hello, hello. Hey, I know we just meet up and all but can you do me a favor? 
diag_s5_r5 = Could you, like, go away? And not come back? Thanks in advance!
diag_s5_r6 = What about I go straight ahead and stop whatever is the latest Incident in town?
diag_s5_r7 = Oh! Your here because of the rain? Arrffff, I KNEW it, what a pain! 
diag_s5_r8 = You're sure you don't just spontaneously have an urge to leave already? 
diag_s5_r9 = Alright, start of Extermination in 5...4...3...2...
diag_s5_r10 = Wait, listen! We are just trying to leave this place, so if you let the flood happen, we'll be gone in no time! 
diag_s5_r11 = I strangely don't feel drawn to the idea of you destroying the place I live in.
diag_s5_r12 = Only one World disappearing? Big deal. Come on, Nobody will ever miss you!
diag_s5_r13 = That's kind of the point of Gensokyo to not be missed but whatever, stay in your little bubble.
diag_s5_r14 = Uh...No? That's EXACTLY what we are trying to not do. I already told you, we are trying to leave your fake World. 
diag_s5_r15 = Fake?
diag_s5_r16 = Yeah? You know, like, you can literally pierce it? Not the strongest thing ever, your Border.
diag_s5_r17 = empty
diag_s5_r18 = So you are ALSO responsible for the hole in the sky? Is it Christmas? I got to solve two incident at once!
diag_s5_r19 = Come again? I cannot allow you to go further, you know? We can't stay here, and the sooner we leave the better. 
diag_s5_r20 = Rest assured, I'll gladly help you later to leave Gensokyo by kicking you out of it.
diag_s5_r21 = Serves you right! I hope you liked that demonstration of what a Shinto Shrine Maiden can do!
diag_s5_r22 = Why are you telling me this like I'm part of some religious movement? Cause we aren't.
diag_s5_r23 = Oh? I thought that...Nevermind. I won, you lose. Bring in the real deal!
diag_s5_r24 = Dang it! I oughta do a report on the situation.
diag_s5_r25 = I'm leaving now, but do not follow me. I'm not going to see the one causing the rain or anything. See you...not!
diag_s5_r26 = Hey! You think you can just leave like that? Come back here!

diag_s5_m1 = Why do Incidents always makes me go throught giant empty hallway that seems to never ends?
diag_s5_m2 = What's up people, can't afford a good architect? 
diag_s5_m3 = Yeah, this place is kinda big.
diag_s5_m4 = Even I can get lost sometimes. But at least, there is a lot of place for us animals! 
diag_s5_m5 = Sadly, there is no room for you! So I'll ask you too leave at once!
diag_s5_m6 = Sure, I'll leave by going straight ahead and see who's your Boss.
diag_s5_m7 = Oh. I understand why you're here now. But yeah, could you like, not intervene please? It's for everyone's sake.
diag_s5_m8 = With this flood, we will leave this place, and your World will be uterely destroyed. Truely a win-win situation!
diag_s5_m9 = The marketplace god herslef wouldn't beleive a trade that fair would exists.
diag_s5_m10 = But I'm more a "take" gal than a "trade" one, so I can't let you guys force me to do trades.
diag_s5_m11 = What a pain. Pitiful creature living in a pitiful World. 
diag_s5_m12 = The day you will die, no one will be caring, no one will shed a single tear and no one will be remembering you.
diag_s5_m13 = That's why I'm living in Gensokyo! You don't fear those kind of things here! You just gotta live!
diag_s5_m14 = You're only saying this because you don't know anything beyond your little Bubble. 
diag_s5_m15 = Should it pop, you wouldn't have much left to cry. 
diag_s5_m16 = Actually, that's an euphemism, you and everything you have ever known would be gone forever.
diag_s5_m17 = Eh. We can't get be forgotten more than we already are.
diag_s5_m18 = But what we REALLY care about, is beating people like you that act out like they are super important and all.
diag_s5_m19 = Guess that fighting is unavoidable. Too bad. But don't go thinking I'm no opponent just because I'm a pet! 
diag_s5_m20 = Don't worry, I wasn't thinking anything about you at all.
diag_s5_m21 = *Pop* Y'hear that? That's the sounds of a bubble poping. I already heard it inside another ship.
diag_s5_m22 = You don't have a single clue of what you are talking about...
diag_s5_m23 = But this is bad! I don't want to be stuck down here! Birds need space to fly and this place is suffocating!
diag_s5_m24 = Why does it have to be this compliacted? How did it comes to this?
diag_s5_m25 = I beat you up, remember?
diag_s5_m26 = Hey, I'll be leaving, but I'm totally going in the wrong direction, so don't follow me. See you and get lost.
diag_s5_m27 = Homing pigeon always finds their way back home, eh?

diag_s5_s1 = I can faintly hear the rain through the walls...
diag_s5_s2 = Ahhh...It feels goods. Gotta love the sounds of rain on woods!
diag_s5_s3 = What the heck are you monologuing about?
diag_s5_s4 = And what are you doing here? This is no place for humans! I don't want you in my way, I have stuff to do.
diag_s5_s5 = I was strolling, casually listening to the rain you guys were causing outside. 
diag_s5_s6 = Oh. I see. Flooding and destroying whole Worlds isn't quite an acceptable thing yet?
diag_s5_s7 = Wow, okay, it escalated quickly but I'm glad we're on the same page.
diag_s5_s8 = But don't worry, for your World is nothing but a counterfeit. So losing it isn't much of a loss in the long run.
diag_s5_s9 = That be sad for me! I already forfeit my past life to come here, I don't want Gensokyo to be gone just now!
diag_s5_s10 = Humans are as materialistic as always. Living in their own little bubble. 
diag_s5_s11 = Well, sorry if I want to LIVE!
diag_s5_s12 = You don't live, you only satisfy yourself with your ignorance. Blinding yourself to what you do not understand.
diag_s5_s13 = Why are you lecturing me? I just want to beat people up and have fun! 
diag_s5_s14 = YOU'RE the one really living in a bubble right now, with all your big speech and such!
diag_s5_s15 = It has been a long time since my Bubble is gone. I don't feel at home in any other and she feels the same as me.
diag_s5_s16 = This is why we will be leaving this place at once. So please, be a nice girl and don't be a pain for me!
diag_s5_s17 = Uh, uh! The rule here is simple: If you try to do bad stuff, a cute girl will show up and beat you up in a flash!
diag_s5_s18 = ...And where is she?
diag_s5_s19 = Okay. You are dead.
diag_s5_s20 = Should I put this little bird in cage? Maybe I can make her sing for me?
diag_s5_s21 = I am NOT singing for you or for anyone else for that matter!
diag_s5_s22 = Why can't things be simple and you just let us to our stuff? That'd make my life way easier!
diag_s5_s23 = Dang it! I'll have to make a report now. 
diag_s5_s24 = Tell your Master I say hi and that I'm approaching at alarming speed.
diag_s5_s25 = I won't, cause I'm going to do something unrelated to what I just said. Now, shoo, leave me alone!
diag_s5_s26 = Got it. I'm right behind you!


diag_s6_r1 = Don't you ever know when it's time to give up?
diag_s6_r2 = I'M the one suppose to say this, you know?
diag_s6_r3 = All of this rain!
diag_s6_r4 = Alright, I have had enough. Show yourself now!
diag_s6_r5 = What is it? Stowaways?
diag_s6_r6 = If it's for a ride out of this World, we do not take passengers. Even less so when they invite themselves. 
diag_s6_r7 = No one will be leaving Gensokyo today, should it be me, you or anyone trying to mess with the Barrier.
diag_s6_r8 = A ship can only stay at bay for so long. And This place is not the harbor we have been looking for.
diag_s6_r9 = But allow me to introduce myself. Nua Kozui, Captain of the Great Ark and currently looking for a new home.
diag_s6_r10 = Reimu Hakurei, Shrine Maiden and profesional Youkai-jutsu martial art amateur.
diag_s6_r11 = And I also stops Incidents-maker during my free time. You know, people like you.
diag_s6_r12 = What? We are merely trying to take our leave!
diag_s6_r13 = My ability to cause floods will allow our fleet to reach for the broken sky and take back our freedom!
diag_s6_r14 = Yeah, but I'd prefer a methode that doesn't include the destruction of Gensokyo. You know, for convenience?
diag_s6_r15 = This Bubble is suffocating, you know that? It's so small, it really feels like a bird-cage...
diag_s6_r16 = Did you broke our sky just to tell me that this place sucks? That's some serious dedication...
diag_s6_r17 = Our docking down here wasn't planned, you see. We kind of...sank.
diag_s6_r18 = And of course, your little insignifant Barrier couldn't handle the sheer weight of my proud ship!
diag_s6_r19 = You...sank? Sinking, bubbles, is Gensokyo nothing but a giant bath to you?
diag_s6_r20 = Ah, ah! You're not even that far off. Except you are not the bathtub but mere foam!
diag_s6_r21 = Okay, I officialy give up on the idea to understand anything anyone is saying in that boat...
diag_s6_r22 = And when I don't understand things, I just shoot down whatever is in front of me!
diag_s6_r23 = As expected, humans just can't get the bigger picture. What frivolous creatures.
diag_s6_r24 = Nua: I will not be regretting this World once it's gone!                           Reimu: Gensokyo love dreaming people.

diag_s6_m1 = Can you tell me what word you don't understand in "Don't follow me." exactly?
diag_s6_m2 = Why "Don't" obviously.
diag_s6_m3 = Now that I think about it. An Incident about rain...
diag_s6_m4 = I somehow got the feeling I already saw that before?
diag_s6_m5 = What am I hearing? Stowaways?
diag_s6_m6 = Oh. Nevermind, it's just a little girl. Too bad for you, human passengers are forbidden.
diag_s6_m7 = For it to be passengers, this thing needs to start moving, and thus the one causing the rain still standing.
diag_s6_m8 = Nothing can stop the Great Ark from reaching the broken sky, but allow me nontheless to introduce myself. 
diag_s6_m9 = I'm Nua Kozui! I've been sailing through Worlds since God knows how long in the hope of finding my new home.
diag_s6_m10 = The name's Reimu Hakurei, I love starving to death and having impossible to capture Last-Word. 
diag_s6_m11 = Tell me, young Kirisame, I can see the stars you have in your eyes. That thirst of freedom... 
diag_s6_m12 = It's really beautiful out there, outside this Bubble. All those Worlds in an endless scenery...
diag_s6_m13 = Beautiful, but very lonely. Luckly for me, I have all of my pets!
diag_s6_m14 = You said "Tell me" but then you talked about yourself and didn't asked a single question.
diag_s6_m15 = How did I broke the sky you asked? To be frank, it was an accident. We sunk at sea. Or at Bubble I guess.
diag_s6_m16 = Because, why would anyone willingly go in this stifling World? It feels like a giant cage!
diag_s6_m17 = You should thanks me! Thanks to my ability to cause floods, I shall free you from this prison!
diag_s6_m18 = Say, how many people did you bored to death by talking non-stop?
diag_s6_m19 = None?
diag_s6_m20 = You missed the punchline, but I'll say it anyway: Thirteen.
diag_s6_m21 = Having discussion with humans is such a pain.
diag_s6_m22 = No wonder, you're talking alone.
diag_s6_m23 = Do not worry, I am also qualified when it comes to more violent exchanges!
diag_s6_m24 = Nua: Now come drowning like the rest of your counterfeit World!                Marisa: Will you shut up, Murasa 2?

diag_s6_s1 = Leave. Me. Alone. Please use your human brain to recognize this human speech pattern!
diag_s6_s2 = The mighty Space Warrior is dangerously approaching the one that is pulling the strings. 
diag_s6_s3 = The Marvelous Sanae has reached the Evil Lord's lair...
diag_s6_s4 = In an heroic and eloquent way, she claims: "AH AH! Found you!"!
diag_s6_s5 = What is all this noise? A stowaway?
diag_s6_s6 = A human no less. If it's for asking me to take you out of this World, while I understand your pain, it's no.
diag_s6_s7 = Tada! You though I wouldn't came and stop you, did you? AH! Wrong, wrong, and alpha wrong! Here am I!
diag_s6_s8 = ...And who are you?
diag_s6_s9 = I am the "Miraculous, Great and Wonderful Deified Wind Priestess of the Mountain, Loved by Gods and Childs"!
diag_s6_s10 = Also known as Sanae Kochiya.
diag_s6_s11 = Guess we are at presentations now. Nua Kozui is my name. Captain of the Great Ark and leaving this place.
diag_s6_s12 = Trying to flee after seeing me? I understand, I understand. Don't worry, I get it, It's okay.
diag_s6_s13 = It's this giant prison I'm trying to leave! I'm currently looking for a new home, but this place's too small!
diag_s6_s14 = But thanks to my ability, our strand will finally ends once the water level reaches the sky!
diag_s6_s15 = Your strand? You stranded in Gensokyo? Ah, ah! How?
diag_s6_s16 = Well, you see, we hit something while sailing up there and we sank, shattering your Barrier in the process.
diag_s6_s17 = That things must have been pretty massive to damage my beloved ship, but here we are.
diag_s6_s18 = My most trusted pet told me she saw a Leviathan, but I wouldn't go believing a bird on that.
diag_s6_s19 = What in the world are you talking about? I'm so confused!
diag_s6_s20 = The important part is: We go and this dummy World cease to exists.
diag_s6_s21 = So you will understand I can't a let little girl who believe to be a superhero impede with my plans!
diag_s6_s22 = It doesn't change the fact that Green Power Sanae is here to save the day! And all the other days while at it!
diag_s6_s23 = I think the idea of you wanting to fight me went through by now. But worry not, I shall stand to your expectations!
diag_s6_s24 = Nua: All aboard! Destination, your World's imminent doom!                    Sanae: Super Sanae Mode Ultra Fight!   


diag_s7_r1 = The broken sky is so pretty, don't you think? I could be watching it for hours!
diag_s7_r2 = Enjoy it while it lasts, it will be gone very shortly.
diag_s7_r3 = What? No way! I want it to stay that way forever!! >:(
diag_s7_r4 = Yukari told me that even she couldn't fix the Barrier with a tear that big.
diag_s7_r5 = Yeah? Like I would believe anything she said to me!
diag_s7_r6 = Yukari? THAT's a name I didn't heard in a LONG time!
diag_s7_r7 = Ciao Bella! I saw Nua was causing some trouble to your World? My apologies. She has always been a little impulsive.
diag_s7_r8 = So you're that god of bubbles or whatever, right?
diag_s7_r9 = Exact. I am Reverence, the God and creator of every Worlds.
diag_s7_r10 = Hold on...Could it be that you are one of the Youkai Sages? 
diag_s7_r11 = I am no Youkai, nor am I very sage. That's why I'm down there in the first place.
diag_s7_r12 = This World is really cute! Teeny tiny little Bubble. But quite fragile, as we can see.
diag_s7_r13 = That Yukari person did a good job, but artificial Barrier can only do so much.
diag_s7_r14 = Yeah, and the same Yukari told me you could easily fix Gensoyko's sky.
diag_s7_r15 = It is true. It's largely within my capabilities.
diag_s7_r16 = So do it?
diag_s7_r17 = No. 
diag_s7_r18 = I've figured it wasn't going to be that easy...
diag_s7_r19 = Sorry Carmen, but the god that I am can't interfere with whatever is happening to their creations!
diag_s7_r20 = I'm not in a position to say what should or shouldn't happen. If your World is decading, it means it has to be so.
diag_s7_r21 = Didn't you just said you aren't the one who created Gensokyo?
diag_s7_r22 = That's beside the point.
diag_s7_r23 = I'm pretty sure it's exactly on it.
diag_s7_r24 = But it's too late now. You entered Gensokyo, so you now have to play by it rules.
diag_s7_r25 = Wanting to pick up a fight? You remind me of that Yukari lady.
diag_s7_r26 = Please, don't go insulting me like that. But yeah, that's the plan.
diag_s7_r27 = How amusing. How adorable. Understood. I will play your little child game.
diag_s7_r28 = So please now, silence in the audience, and...
diag_s7_r29 = Music, Maestro!
diag_s7_r30 = Bravo! Formidable! To think a human could stand up against a god!
diag_s7_r31 = You gods REALLY like to say this whenever I beat you up...
diag_s7_r32 = This place is really full of surprises! I like it! I'm sure Nua is thinking the same!
diag_s7_r33 = Could this place be the one she has been looking for all of these years? 
diag_s7_r34 = I don't know and I don't care. Just fix the sky already.
diag_s7_r35 = Ah, ah! Alright! I want to see more of what this World can offer now!
diag_s7_r36 = What color do you want your new sky to be? Green? Purple? Octarine Maybe?
diag_s7_r37 = Just make it blue, that will be enough!

diag_s7_m1 = Back by popular demand: Me! :D
diag_s7_m2 = Don't expect me to join your inexisting fan club.
diag_s7_m3 = I couldn't let my fans await my return any longer! ^^
diag_s7_m4 = Here am I, back to the giant boat, running after some soap god.
diag_s7_m5 = I don't get how soap can fix a broken sky but hey, I'm ready to be surprised.
diag_s7_m6 = Ah ah, silly Nua. She's still a real child at heart, isn't she?
diag_s7_m7 = Ciao Bella! You're the human who came here earlier to stop Nua, right? 
diag_s7_m8 = Please, forgive her for her bad manners. She doesn't have much occasion to interact with other humans.
diag_s7_m9 = You know someone is a god when they have asymmetrical clothes and weird back ornament.
diag_s7_m10 = A god, I am! Reverence U'n-Llisardggy, creator of everything except for this place!
diag_s7_m11 = Oh, I get it now! You are the god of soap because you created soap?
diag_s7_m12 = I am NOT a soap god! I already told you that, didn't I?
diag_s7_m13 = I don't think you did. Hey, now that we're buddy-buddy, can you fix the sky?
diag_s7_m14 = Yes, I can.
diag_s7_m15 = Will you do it?
diag_s7_m16 = No, I won't.
diag_s7_m17 = Yep, that's gods for you.
diag_s7_m18 = That's all they are. Gods will let things happen as they thappen, because it is how they should be happening.
diag_s7_m19 = Guess gods in Gensokyo skipped god school, because they don't care in the slightest about that.
diag_s7_m20 = So you'll understand I can't possibly take actions and decide whether or not this World should exists or not.
diag_s7_m21 = Technically, by not doing anything, don't you decide that it shouldn't?
diag_s7_m22 = Omission is no action. But it is true that forgetting a World is quite crueler than destroying it.
diag_s7_m23 = So I'll stick around until this World is completely gone! How merciful of me!
diag_s7_m24 = If gods are like that now, I'll start to convert myself to atheism.
diag_s7_m25 = And I respect it.
diag_s7_m26 = But in order to be atheist, I must defeat every existing god. And there happen to be one just in front of me.
diag_s7_m27 = Your conversion went pretty fast. I'm impressed.
diag_s7_m28 = Now, the orchestra has taken it seats! The show can finally begins!
diag_s7_m29 = Here is my latest composition: "Summertime Rhapsody of a Dying World"!
diag_s7_m30 = Hallelujah! Wonderful! Very impressive for a human!
diag_s7_m31 = I give up on being atheist, it's way too much work.
diag_s7_m32 = Knowing Nua, she probably find this World to be very small...
diag_s7_m33 = But if everyone is as strong as you, she'll definitely have a lot of fun down here!
diag_s7_m34 = I too had a ton of fun! I'll repair your broken sky right away to apologize for my condescendant behaviour.
diag_s7_m35 = Go ahead.
diag_s7_m36 = I'll be watching you. I want to know how you'll fix it with only soap.
diag_s7_m37 = You don't actually want me to do it, right?

diag_s7_s1 = Hey Lady Kochiya, it's not raining anymore! So, what I wanted to tell you was...
diag_s7_s2 = You again? I'm tired of you taunting me with my fan, just give it back to me already! It was my favourite!
diag_s7_s3 = Dont' try to flatter me! This time, you ARE going to listen to what I have to say! >:(
diag_s7_s4 = I have no idea of what I am doing. Is that bubble god really around here?
diag_s7_s5 = It's not like I can go closer to the Barrier, Gensokyo being non-euclidean and stuff. 
diag_s7_s6 = Gensokyo? Is that the name of this World?
diag_s7_s7 = Ciao Bella! You're the one who came earlier, right? I thank you for stopping Nua from doing stupid things.
diag_s7_s8 = Oh my God!
diag_s7_s9 = That's me.
diag_s7_s10 = Finally! After all of these years! An extraterrestrial encounter! 
diag_s7_s11 = The last one I saw with red and blue wings was a fake alien, but this time it's the real deal!
diag_s7_s12 = I guess? It's more of an extra-universal encounter, wouldn't it be?
diag_s7_s13 = And more than that, I am also a God. Reverence U'n-Llisardggy, creator of many Worlds and many universes!
diag_s7_s14 = I'm Sanae, creator of the anmitsu with oden.
diag_s7_s15 = It's the first time I came down there, in "Gensokyo". That's a cute name. A cute name for a cute dying World.
diag_s7_s16 = But you're the bubble god, aren't you? Can't you just fix the sky? I was told you could.
diag_s7_s17 = I can.
diag_s7_s18 = But I won't.
diag_s7_s19 = I swear to them, gods really are the laziest species in existence!
diag_s7_s20 = It is not a question of motivation, but rather of reasons.
diag_s7_s21 = I would need to be the most pretentious god ever to say what should or shouldn't happen.
diag_s7_s22 = Nua broke your Barrier by accident, it had to be so. Your World will soon perish because of it, it had to be so.
diag_s7_s23 = I see. And is it also written that I will soon start to beat you up?
diag_s7_s24 = It is only the natural course of actions. If you want to fight, it couldn't have happen any other way.
diag_s7_s25 = The question now is: Peace or violence?
diag_s7_s26 = Answer B: Violence. I thought I was pretty clear on it. What do I win?
diag_s7_s27 = A Danse Macabre with your truly.
diag_s7_s28 = That sounds like a lot of fun.
diag_s7_s29 = Glad you like your prize! And if you are ready to go...
diag_s7_s30 = Alors on danse!
diag_s7_s31 = Wonderful! I'm speechless! Never did I had such an intense battle before!
diag_s7_s32 = And that's another victory for Super Sanae! Peace as been restored with violence once again!

spell_comment = Spell Comment:

com_s1_mide = Apple has a lot of existing differents design out there. Now there is one more.$It's more "Minoriko-like" than "literally an apple" since she isn't a "personification of an apple" but a simple apple Youkai here.
com_s1_midn = Apple will sometimes makes apple pie out of the apple she grew.$They sadly are just as popular as her unprepared apples.$Yeah, and the name is in German because "Apple Pie" is a really boring name for a spell.
com_s1_midh = The first two human have been banish from heaven from eating the forbidden fruit.$While that fruit is an apple in most people head, its true nature is not really clear and is up to interpretation.
com_s1_midl = In that case, the Adam's apple's name can be changed to whatever fruit you want it to be.$The Adam's pear? The Adam's fig? The Adam's Pitaya? You name it!
com_s1_1e = One day, while roaming around, an apple fell right on Apple head. She realized that day how much Danmaku potential apples really have.
com_s1_1n = Newton's third law is the law of Action and Reaction. It can easily be explained like so:$Action: the Boss shoots Danmaku.$Reaction: You try to not die (and fail).
com_s1_1h = The Mt. Fuji and the apples from the Fuji variety share their names.$Honestly, anyone would immediately rejoice after hearing such a cool fact.
com_s1_1l = Apple is sadly not a Wizard from Mt. Fuji.$Also there is no power system in this game.$And also Reimu doesn't mention diabetes.
com_s1_2e = Not a lot of people will eat Apple's apple, so she always ends up with baskets full of rotten ones.$At least, she can still throw them at your face. 
com_s1_2n = Did you know that Apple is Eirin's arch nemesis?
com_s1_2h = Apple's not that bad, come on, the world isn't black and white! She just doesn't know how to properly interact with peoples.
com_s1_2l = Ever on and on, I continue circling with nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony, till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing and suddenly I see that I can't break free.
com_s2_mide = The weapons and armors of the fallen soldiers slowly sink into to bottom of the sea.$What a peaceful sight...if it wasn't for the corpse of said soldiers.
com_s2_midn = Thanks to all of this equipment, the Heikeganis form a strong society of Samourai-crab living undersea.$The Genji clan is gone since a long time by now, but the Heikeganis will keep bearing grudges over things in order to subsiss.
com_s2_midh = I wonder now...If the Heike were the one being victorious over the Genji, would the Heikeganis have been named Genjigani instead?
com_s2_midl = "How come she has spells with "Enimty" or "Grudge" in its name while she doesn't bear any grudge herself?" I hear you say. That's because she stubbornly tries to conform to her species mindset.$It doesn't work quite well, as you can see by her presence in Gensokyo.
com_s2_1e = This spell is significantly easier than another one with the word "Walk" in it title.$Also, Imagine the knifes in this spell as crabs.
com_s2_1n = Could you, like, stop being a nuisance and step out of the crabs' way?$What do you mean they are actively aiming for you?$You are being paranoid.
com_s2_1h = Now, there is also verticales lanes!$When the knifes come from above, it forces YOU to move horizontaly.$How does it feels like to be a crab now?
com_s2_1l = So many crabs...What a sight! Now, where are they all heading to?$I read "Migration Sign", but is Gensokyo large enough to possibly be migrating somewhere?
com_s2_2e = This game is a bullet-hell shooting game which is based on Japan's history.$Being based on history, the stages of the game are also based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
com_s2_2n = For exemple, this Stage 2, the player will have to fight against an army of enemy fairies.$Not only that, but they will find new and interesting ways to defeat enemies or bosses.
com_s2_2h = So here's this giant enemy crab! What I'll do is use Reimu here to flip over this crab on her back.$See if she shows up...Oh here it comes...
com_s2_2l = I'll switch over to Marisa, hop on its stomach...$And you attack it weak point...for massive damage!
com_s2_3e = The crabs are done with the monkey's mischiefs!$Where is the monkey, you ask?$It's you, obviously. You are the monkey.
com_s2_3n = Serene tried asking for help to a chestnut, to a cow dung, to a bee and to an usu in order to defeat you.$But then she realized that three quarter of those things aren't even alive.
com_s2_3h = The monkey doesn't stand a single chance in this war! Crabs literally are the pinnacle of evolution!$Why do you think species naturally tend to evolve into one? Because they are perfect!
com_s2_3l = If a Touhou monkey character were to actually exists, her and Serene would definitely be strong rivals.$Uh? What do you say? Ran? Two Rans? What are you talking about?
com_s3_mide = 
com_s3_midn = 
com_s3_midh = Being an inanimate object for 100 years is cool and all, but it's kinda boring.$I know it's weird for an eletric fans, of all things, to become a Tsukumogami but they were already around 100 years ago so it's not impossible. 
com_s3_midl = 
com_s3_1e = Which one are you talking about Pale?$There is like 8 billions japanese tales and legends, so you'll need to be more precise here.
com_s3_1n = Say, did you read the Omake?$There is a lot of cool backstories and interesting character descriptions so you should definitely check it out! 
com_s3_1h = And what about all of those awesome spell comments? Are you reading them all? Or at all?$You are AT LEAST reading this one so that's cool.
com_s3_1l = It's called "Fiction Sign" because this is a reading spell with very fast bullet.$Since nobody ever read the dialogues, I have no choice but to make you read Danmaku instead.
com_s3_2e = This spell's name sounds way less impressive when you remember how small Gensokyo truly is.$You can see everything in it in less than 80 days for sure.
com_s3_2n = Do you know about that one song?$You know, the one that goes "Around the world" 144 times in a row?
com_s3_2h = Pale can be a little "fantasque" and fanciful sometimes.$But That's expected from someone living the the fantasyland.
com_s3_2l = This spell really stands to its name! I can barely breathe when doing such a precise manoeuver!$Or maybe is it because I'm lacking oxygen this high in the clouds?
com_s3_3e = Here comes the washing-mach...err I mean the actual fan spell!$I don't know if you get it by now, but Pale likes spinning.$I hope you do too.
com_s3_3n = A survival spell in the main game? How rare!$Pale can't even keep up with her own attack so she will eventually blow up by herself.
com_s3_3h = (Translator's note: Danmaku means bullet curtain)
com_s3_3l = Trust me.$You can believe in the Danmaku.$:)
com_s4_mide = You might be tempted to stop shooting for an easy timeout, but if you do you'll miss on a Bomb Extend.$The choice is yours.
com_s4_midn = The thunder is growling stronger and stronger.$Try to shoot down the familiars when close to them to prevent them from shooting arrows.
com_s4_midh = Now the tension really starts to rise!$Can you keep up with Iku's electric danse?
com_s4_midl = This spell ends up being very different from characters to characters.$For Marisa, it's basically a joke.$For Sanae, it can be quite insane sometimes. 
com_s4_1e = Yuuto has the ability to fuse objects with cookies.$She uses this capacity here offensively by fusing cookies with Danmaku.$I wonder how they taste...
com_s4_1n = This game uses cookies to give you a personalized and targeted experience.$Wait for Yuuto's final spell and you'll see what I mean.
com_s4_1h = There is only one step between cookies and rocks.$I'm thinking about a certain Tsukumogami from a certain book of mythology when I say this.
com_s4_1l = Name a more iconic duo than Yuuto and her rocks.$I'll wait...
com_s4_2e = This one spell is one Yuuto learned when she first came in Gensokyo.$But since she has trouble casting it with her magic alone, she invokes it thought objects using her psychokinesis ability. In that case rocks.
com_s4_2n = If you don't have any rocks lying around, try using a chair. It works just as well.
com_s4_2h = It's Astral Azure, but upgraded now.$In the original game, it allowed what she threw to bounce multiple times but I figured it would have been A LITTLE too much.
com_s4_2l = At last! The spell is finally complete! It has reach its final form!$It's now exactly the same...$But harder!!!
com_s4_3e = This spell looks somewhat familiar, doesn't it?$At least here, you can shoot down her familiars to make your life easier.
com_s4_3n = Patchouli is actually the one that taught Yuuto how to properly use magic and Danmaku.$Yuuto's still not very good at both, but she's getting there!
com_s4_3h = Yuuto learned this mess of a spell in the animal realm World she previously was.$For some reason, those animals could manipulate elemental power.$I mean, so could Yuuto, but she wanted to make one that mixes all of them at once.
com_s4_3l = She made quite a bunch of rivals back there.$She wasn't very good at fighting but at least it allowed her to be here.$By here, I mean both in Gensokyo and in this game.
com_s4_4re = If Yuuto wants one day to not be called a bootleg anymore, she should maybe try to stop mimicking other people's spells.$Here, she saw Reimu's bomb and tried to replicate it.
com_s4_4rn = Despite being a spell card made on the fly, it's still pretty accurate to the original.$It really shows Yuuto's natural plagiarism capability.
com_s4_4rh = Unlike Reimu, Yuuto isn't very good with flying around.$She uses her telekinesis ability to make herself float, but it's very tiring for her.
com_s4_4rl = Do you want to know what's Yuuto's actual biggest strength?$It's her ability to make friends wherever she goes.
com_s4_4me = Now she attempts to reproduce Marisa's bomb.$But she can't possibly be maintaining a Master Spark for more than 1 seconde so she quickly lose control of it.
com_s4_4mn = She has already seen Master Spark in the past, so it was easier for her to recreate the spell.$Or at least tried to.
com_s4_4mh = You'll need a canalyzer if you ever feel like casting a Master Spark yourself, in addition of being capable of using magic.$Yuuto tried to use her spell book as one but it didn't worked quite well.
com_s4_4ml = Yuuto made the promise to become the strongest magician ever to one of her friend.$It's going to be rough, as she isn't the only hard working magician around here.
com_s4_4se = Hold on, this doesn't look like Sanae's bomb?$Why is she so low on the screen? Where are all the lasers?
com_s4_4sn = I got it now, it's suppose to be Sanae's final spell from Mountain of Faith. Makes sense.$No, wait it doesn't, how can Yuuto knows this spell even exists?
com_s4_4sh = It's a truly a miracle she managed to stand THIS long against one of the protagonist.$Trying to imitate Sanae's ability now?
com_s4_4sl = Yuuto's existence is also something of a miracle.$And I love her for that.
com_s5_1e = Feza found an olive branch and is bringing it back to you.$I know someone that can learn a thing or two about the concept of personal space.
com_s5_1n = Olive branches are a sign of peace.$Or at least they are until they're thrown at your face as Danmaku.
com_s5_1h = Finding an olive branch means finding land.$Finding land means finding hope.$For a World of hopes and dreams, Gensokyo sure feels like a birdcage.
com_s5_1l = Olive branches alone aren't enough anymore.$Let's just take the whole damn tree altogether.
com_s5_2e = Sharp-edged leaves flyig all over the screen.$It's like when you cut yourself with paper.$It's seems harmless but it's actually not.
com_s5_2n = Feza being a pet, it only make sense for her to have such a move.$She even has four spells in her boss fight.
com_s5_2h = You thought the branch she's holding was just for look? Think again!$Be careful now. This spell has a high critical-hit ratio!
com_s5_2l = I can't be the only one who has been marked by this move's animation, right?$It's based on the one from the fourth generation and onward.
com_s5_3e = Homming pigeon are known to be able to find their way back home.$Feza wished she even had a home at all.
com_s5_3n = Thanks to her abilities, Feza is basically a living compass.$That's why she's such a good cartographer.
com_s5_3h = Gensokyo, being isolated from the Outside World, has it very own magnetic field.$With Youkai Mountain serving as the "north pole".
com_s5_3l = Feza, you have the whole top of the screen for yourself, please let me at least keep the bottom part of it.
com_s5_4e = Based on this spell, we can see we are currently heading south.$This information doesn't serve any purpose.
com_s5_4n = Or maybe Feza is just trying to show you the exit?$How nice.$Let's ignore her.
com_s5_4h = Danmaku is coming from all four of the cardinal points.$Don't be like the forgotten puppeteer and free yourself from the horizon.
com_s5_4l = If you were wondering what's those paper scroll in Feza's bag are all about, they are maps she made of the place outside Worlds.$They are still mostly incomplete because of the nameless place's infinite nature.
com_s6_mide = There she is again.$Stage 5 bosses really hate giving people a break, uh?
com_s6_midn = If you time this spell out during a run, it looks like Feza is flying into a wall and that's hilarious.
com_s6_midh = Let's take two spell known for their RNG aspect and mix them together!$What could possibly go wrong?
com_s6_midl = When it comes to flying speed, Feza really can't complain.$It still pales compare to Tengu's though.
com_s6_1e = All good captains need to have spells based around anchors!$This one's really big for some reason.
com_s6_1n = The ark landed between two of Bhavaagra's highest peak.$Now it's stuck up there.$But shall Nua's plan be a success, not for long.
com_s6_1h = The damages done to the ship were only superficials.$Feza was quickly able to fix the hull before you even reached her in stage 5.
com_s6_1l = The Great Ark is a special kind of boat.$It's made in Gopher wood, a type of wood that doesn't exists in the universe we live in.
com_s6_2e = This is Nua's myriad of doves. She's using them as living Danmaku!$Do not worry, none were injured during the battle and they all safely went back to the dovecot afterward. 
com_s6_2n = Nua used to send a lot of doves around in order to find habitable World.$Today, Feza can pretty much handle this job by herself.
com_s6_2h = Doves aren't the only pets Nua has. She has A LOT of other ones.$The Great Ark is basically a giant zoo at that point.
com_s6_2l = The ark is so big that whole ecosystems can exist in it, giving Nua's pet a proper place to live.$You can find forests, deserts or even fully submerged places.$Too bad you only get to see a corridor and the wheelhouse of the ark.
com_s6_3e = A spell similar to one of a certain foreign god.$Both Nua and them are related to agriculture so I found it to be fitting.
com_s6_3n = There is places in the ark that are allocated to grape culture and wine making.$Nua herself is a really good winemaker.
com_s6_3h = Seeing Nua not being drunk is a rather rare occurrence.$She only managed to refrain herself for 2 spells before starting to drink.
com_s6_3l = Nua is literally making wine as the fight progresses.$She drank a little too much of it and now you have to deal with whatever is going on in this spell.
com_s6_4e = Nua and Feza are Patriarchs. One can become a Patriarch by being exposed to the nothingness of the nameless place for an extremely long period of time (more details in the Omake).$These two are the only ones to ever reach that state.
com_s6_4n = Once you fully become a Patriarch, you body will cease to change.$This means you stop aging and don't need to sleep or to eat anymore for exemple.$You become a constant. An unchanging yourself.
com_s6_4h = Patriarchs ressent emotions on a lesser scale. Their feelings are inhibited.$Nua tries to compensate this as she can with alcohol.
com_s6_4l = I should maybe talk about the spell now.$Yeah...anchors.$Don't get hit.
com_s6_5e = This is it. Nua's last resort.$Once this land will be fully submerged, the ark shall be freed at last!
com_s6_5n = Nua decided to sped up the flooding process.$Do you think you have what it takes to save this World?
com_s6_5h = Thanks to Nua, Gensokyo now truly starts to ascend!$A little more, and this land shall be cleanse for good!
com_s6_5l = Waking up means the end of dreams. The end of fantasy. The end of Gensokyo.$What will you do now?$Do you want to wake up? Do you want to keep dreaming?
com_s7_mid1 = Danmaku can be considered as a form of art.$If what you are dodging isn't expressing anything, then what's the point?
com_s7_mid2 = Danmaku can be considered as a pure gameplay mecanic.$As long as it's fun to dodge, beauty doesn't matter.
com_s7_mid3 = Who or what is keeping the World spinning around?$Inertia.$It's inertia.
com_s7_1 = God will accept anyone in her home.$You may not believe in God in a literal sense, but you can take it as "the Universe".$The Universe is accepting you. Because you already exists.
com_s7_2 = What about all of those revelations? did I stole them?$No, no, you are mistaken.$Those were given to me.
com_s7_3 = Reverence uses a metronome she found for this spell Card, but it change direction and speed too abruptly to be used correctly. She tries to keep up as she can, but the tempo is too fast to think about a pattern so she just shoots random things.
com_s7_4 = Some peoples just stay unmoved by the Dreamland.$Reverence will refuse to grant wishes but everybody isn't like her.
com_s7_5 = It's called "Flammarion Engraving" but this isn't actually Flammarion's.$Did the actual author knew about Worlds and Reverence, or was it just a lucky close guess?
com_s7_6 = 
com_s7_7 = All of this fight was really tiresome, so Reverence decided to take a short break.$She locks herself in a bubble and let her familiars do the hard work.
com_s7_8 = Did you ever wanted to know how it feels like to be a god? Well today is your chance! $Reverence will gladly forces you into her shoes for you to have a better idea on the subject.
com_s7_9 = The Universe as a pond, a frog resting in its middle.$An epitome of a World.$First Creation, then Expension, and finally Destruction.
com_s7_10 = God is leaving now.$The show is comming to its end.$Should we call for an encore?
